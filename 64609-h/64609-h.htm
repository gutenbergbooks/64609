<small>AN INTERESTING LETTER.</small></h2>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there, you fellows, I&#8217;ve got a letter to read to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a tall, handsome lad, with a frank, pleasant
face, and a wealth of curly brown hair. He wore a close-fitting
gray jacket and trousers. The uniform of a West
Point &#8220;plebe,&#8221; as the new cadet is termed. He was standing
in front of one of the tents in the summer camp of the
corps, and speaking to half a dozen of his classmates.</p>

<p>The six looked up with interest when they heard what
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Mark,&#8221; called one of them. &#8220;Come in here
and read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is addressed to me,&#8221; began Mark Mallory, obeying
the request and sitting down. &#8220;But it&#8217;s really meant
for the whole seven of us. And it&#8217;s interesting, as showing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
what the old cadets think of the tricks we bold plebes
have been playing on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s it from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Wicks Merritt, the second classman I met
here last year. He&#8217;s home on furlough for the summer,
but some of the other cadets have written and told him
about us, and what we&#8217;ve been doing. And this is what
he says about it. Listen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Mark</span>: Whenever I sit down to write to you it
seems to me I can think of nothing to say, but to marvel
at the extraordinary rumpus you have kicked up at West
Point. Every time I hear from there you are doing still
more incredibly impossible acts, until I expect to hear next
that you have been made superintendent or something.
However, in this letter I really have something else to
tell you about, but I shall put it off to the last and keep
you in suspense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hear that, not satisfied with defying the yearlings
to haze you, and actually keeping them from doing
it, which is something no plebe has ever dared to dream
of before, you have gone on to still further recklessness.
They say that you have gotten half a dozen other plebes to
back you up, and that, to cap the climax, you actually
dared to go to one of the hops. Well, I do not know
what to say to that; it simply takes my breath away. I
should like to have been there to see him doing it. They
say that Grace Fuller, the girl you saved from drowning,
got all the girls to promise to dance with you, and that the
end of the whole business was the yearlings stopped the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
music and the hop and left in disgust. I fairly gasp when
I picture that scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hesitate to give an original person like you advice.
You never heeded what I gave you anyway, but went
right ahead in your own contrariness to do what you
pleased. I guess you were right. But I want to warn
you a little. By your unheard-of daring in going to that
hop you have incurred the enmity of not only the yearlings,
whom you have beaten at every turn, but also of the
powerful first class as well. And they will never stop
until they subdue you. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll try, but
it will be something desperate, and you must stand the
consequences. You&#8217;ll probably have to take turns fighting
every man in the class. When I come back I expect
to find you buried six feet deep in court-plaster.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Mark looked up from the letter for a moment, and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the dear old chump could see me now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Wicks&#8217; prediction seemed nearly fulfilled. Mark&#8217;s face
was bruised and bandaged; one shoulder was still immovable
from a dislocation, and when he moved any other
part of himself he did it with a cautious slowness that told
of sundry aching joints.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; growled one of the six listeners, a lad from
Texas, with a curious cowboy accent. &#8220;Yes, hang it!
But I reckon Wicks Merritt didn&#8217;t have any idea them
ole cadets&#8217;d pile on to lick you all together. I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
what, it gits me riled. Jes&#8217; because you had the nerve to
defy &#8217;em and fight the feller that ordered you off that air
hop floor, doggone &#8217;em, they all had to pitch in and beat
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Texas,&#8221; laughed Mark, cheerfully.
&#8220;They were welcome. I knocked out my man, which was
what I went out for. And besides, we managed to outwit
them in the end, leaving them deserted and scared to death
on the opposite shore of the Hudson. You&#8217;ve heard of
clouds with silver linings. I&#8217;m off duty and can play the
gentleman all day, and not have to turn out and drill like
you unfortunate plebes. And, moreover, nobody offers to
haze me any more while I&#8217;m a cripple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be jes&#8217; like &#8217;em to,&#8221; growled Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s got nothing to do with the letter,&#8221; responded
Mark. &#8220;There is some news in here that&#8217;ll interest you
fellows, if Texas would only stop growling at the cadets
long enough to give me a chance. Too much fighting is
spoiling your gentle disposition, Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as,&#8221; grinned the Southerner. &#8220;You jes&#8217; go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; continued Mark. &#8220;Listen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I got a letter from Fischer yesterday. Fischer is captain
of your company, I think. He tells me that that rascally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Benny Bartlett, the fellow from your town who tried
to cheat you out of your appointment, but whom you beat
at the examinations, turned up a short while ago with a
brand-new plot to get you into trouble. It reads like a
fairy story, what Fischer told me. He had a printer&#8217;s boy
hired to accuse you of bribing him to steal for you the
exam. papers. The superintendent believed him and you
were almost fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fischer says he went out at night with that wild chum
of yours, Texas, and the two of them held up the printer&#8217;s
boy and robbed him of some papers that showed his guilt.
Well, Mr. Mallory, I certainly congratulate you on your
luck. You owe a debt of gratitude to Fischer, who ought
to be your enemy really, since he was one of the hop
managers you riled so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now for the news I have. I write to tell you&mdash;and
I know it will surprise you&mdash;that you are not yet
through with that troublesome Master Bartlett.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; echoed Texas, springing up in surprise.
&#8220;What does he know &#8217;bout it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; laughed Mark, by way of answer. &#8220;Wait, and
you&#8217;ll see. Wicks is quite a detective.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;As you&#8217;ll notice by the postmark of this letter, I am
in Washington, D. C., at present. And what do you
think? I have met Benny Bartlett here!</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hear you gasp when you read that. I knew
him, but he didn&#8217;t know me, so I made up my mind to
have some fun with him. I picked up an acquaintance
with him, and told him I was from West Point. Then
he got intimate and confidential, said he knew a confounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
fresh plebe up there&mdash;Mallory, they called him.
Well, I said I&#8217;d heard of Mallory. And, Mark, I nearly
had him wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, you know, he hates you like poison.
I can&#8217;t tell you how much. This paper wouldn&#8217;t hold all
the names he called you. And, oh, what lies he did tell
about you! So I thought to tease him I&#8217;d take the other
tack. I told him of all your heroism, how you&#8217;d saved the
life of the daughter of a rich old judge up there, and were
engaged to marry her some day. I threw that in for good
measure, though they say it is a desperate case between
you and her&mdash;upon which I congratulate you, for she&#8217;s a
treasure.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what he&#8217;d say,&#8221; put in one of the six, &#8220;if he
knew she&#8217;d joined the Banded Seven to help fool the
yearlings?&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I told him,&#8221; continued Mark, reading, &#8220;all about how
you&#8217;d prevented hazing and were literally running the
place. Then I showed him Fischer&#8217;s letter to cap the
climax. And, Mark, the kid was crazy. He vowed he
was coming up there to balk you, if it was the last thing
he ever did on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;His father has a big pull with the President, and is
using it with a vengeance. He pleads that his son did
magnificently at the congressman&#8217;s exams, and only failed
at the others because he was ill. And so Benny expects
to turn up to annoy you as one of the plebes who come in
when camp breaks up on the 28th of August.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having warned you of this disagreeable possibility
nothing now remains for me to do but wish you the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
possible luck in your quarrel with the first class, and so
sign myself,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">&#8220;Sincerely yours,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Wicks Merritt</span>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The Seven stared at each other as Mark folded up the
letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got just one month to wait,
just one month. Then that contemptible fellow will be
here to bother us. But in the meantime I say we forget
about him. He&#8217;s unpleasant to think about. Let&#8217;s not
mention him again until we see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Parson echoed, &#8220;Yea, by Zeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson was just the same old parson he was the
day he first struck West Point. Frequent hazings had not
robbed him of his quiet and classic dignity; and still more
frequent battles with &#8220;the enemy&#8221; had not made him a
whit less learned and studious. He was from Boston,
was Parson Stanard, and he was proud of it. Also, he
was a geologist of erudition most astoundingly deep. He
had a bag of most wonderful fossils hidden away in his
tent, fossils with names as long as the Parson&#8217;s venerable
and bony legs in their pale green socks.</p>

<p>The Parson was not wholly devoted to fossils, for he
was member No. 3 in our Banded Seven, of which Mark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
was the leader. No. 4 was &#8220;Indian,&#8221; the fat and gullible
and much hazed Joe Smith, of Indianapolis. After him
came the merry and handsome Dewey, otherwise known
as &#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; the prize story-teller of the crowd. Chauncey,
surnamed &#8220;the dude,&#8221; and Sleepy, &#8220;the farmer,&#8221; made up
the rest of that bold and valiant band which was notorious
for its &#8220;B. J.-ness.&#8221; (B. J., before June, means
freshness.)</p>

<p>Master Benjamin Bartlett having been laid on the shelf
for a month, the Seven cast about them for a new subject of
conversation to while away the half hour of &#8220;recreation&#8221;
allotted to them between the morning&#8217;s drill and dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know,&#8221; suggested Dewey, &#8220;what shall we do
this afternoon, b&#8217;gee?&#8221;</p>

<p>That afternoon was Saturday (&#8220;the first Saturday we&#8217;ve
had for a week,&#8221; as Dewey sagely informed them, whereat
Indian cried out: &#8220;Of course! Bless my soul! How could
it be otherwise?&#8221;) Saturday is a half holiday for the
cadets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;I hardly think the yearlings&#8217;ll
try any hazing to-day. They&#8217;re waiting to see
what the first class&#8217;ll do when I get well enough to fight
them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>The Parson arose to his feet with dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my purpose,&#8221; he said, with grave decision, &#8220;to undertake
an excursion into the mountainous country in
back of us, particularly to the portion known as the habitation
of the Corous Americanus&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The habitation of the what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the Corous Americanus. You have probably heard
the mountain spoken of as &#8216;Crow&#8217;s Nest,&#8217; but I prefer the
other more scientific and accurate name, since there are
in America numerous species of crows, some forty-seven
in all, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The six sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my purpose,&#8221; continued the Parson, blinking solemnly
as any wise old owl, &#8220;to admire the beauties of the
scenery, and also to conduct a little cursory geological investigation
in order to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; interrupted Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; inquired the Parson.</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you mean you&#8217;re a-goin&#8217; to take a walk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes,&#8221; said the Parson, &#8220;that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all go,&#8221; interrupted Texas. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see
some o&#8217; that there geologizin&#8217; o&#8217; yourn.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>&#8220;I shall be delighted to extend you an invitation,&#8221; said
the other, cordially.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that the Banded Seven took a
walk back in the mountains that Saturday afternoon.
That walk was the most momentous walk that those lads
ever had occasion to take.</p>

<small>WHAT A WALK LED TO.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a strangely accoutered cavalcade that set out
from this West Point camp an hour or so later. The
Parson, as guide and temporary chief, led the way, having
his beloved &#8220;Dana&#8217;s Geology&#8221; under his arms, and bearing
in one hand an &#8220;astrology&#8221; hammer (as Texas termed
it), in the other a capacious bag in which he purposed to
carry any interesting specimens he chanced to find. The
Parson had brought with him to West Point his professional
coat, with huge pockets for that purpose, but
being a cadet he was not allowed to wear it.</p>

<p>Chauncey and Indian brought up the rear. Chauncey
was picking his way delicately along, fearful of spoiling
a beautiful new shine he had just had put on. And Indian
was in mortal terror lest some of the ghosts, bears,
tramps or snakes which the yearlings had assured him
filled the woods, should spring out upon his fat, perspiring
little self.</p>

<p>The government property at West Point extends for
some four miles up the Hudson, and quite a distance into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the wild mountains to the rear. The government property
is equivalent to &#8220;cadet limits,&#8221; and so the woods are
freely roamed by the venturesome lads on holiday afternoons.</p>

<p>The Parson was never more thoroughly in his element
than he was just then. He was a learned professor, escorting
a group of patient and willing pupils. The information
which he gave out in solid chunks that afternoon
would have filled an encyclop&aelig;dia. A dozen times every
hour he would stop and hold forth upon some newly observed
object.</p>

<p>But it was when on geology that the Parson was at
home. He might dabble in all sciences; in fact, he considered
it the duty of a scholar to do so; but geology was
his specialty, his own, his pet and paragon. And never
did he wax so eloquently as when he was talking of
geology, &#8220;That science which unravels the mysteries of
ages, that reads in the rocks of the present the silent
stories of the years that are dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold yon towering precipice,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;with its
crevices torn by the winter&#8217;s snows and rains! Gentlemen,
I suppose you know that the substances which we
call earth and sand are but the result of the ceaseless action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of water, which tore it from the mountains and
ground it into the ever-moving seas. It was water that
carved the mountains from the masses of ancient rock,
and water that cut the valleys that lead to the sea below.
A wonderful thing is water to the geologist, a strange
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strange thing to a Texan, too,&#8221; observed the incorrigible
cowboy, making a sound like a popping cork.</p>

<p>&#8220;This cliff, all covered with vegetation,&#8221; continued the
Parson, gazing up into the air, &#8220;has a story to tell also.
See that scar running across its surface? In the glacial
era, when this valley was a mass of grinding, sliding ice,
some great stone caught in the mass plowed that furrow
which you see. And perhaps hundreds of miles below
here I might find the stone that would fit that mark.
That has been done by many a patient scientist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The six were staring at the cliff in open-mouthed interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the post-tertiary periods,&#8221; continued the lecturer,
&#8220;this Hudson Valley was an inland sea. By that line of
colored rock, denoting the top of the strata, I can tell
what was the level of that body of water. The storms of
that period did great havoc among the rocks. This cliff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
may have been torn and burrowed; I know of some that
had great caves and passageways worn in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The six were still staring.</p>

<p>&#8220;We find many wonderful fossils in such rock. The
seas then were inhabitated by many gigantic animals,
whose skeletons we find, completely buried in stone. I
have the foot of a Megatherium, the foot being about as
broad as my arm is long, found in some shistose quartz
of this period. If you will excuse me for but a few moments
I should like to examine the fragments at the bottom
of the cliff and see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I see a foot there!&#8221; cried Mark, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded the Parson, no less so, his eyes
flashing with professional zeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the foot of the cliff,&#8221; responded Mark. &#8220;Do you
see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson turned away with a grieved look and fell
to chipping at the rock. The rest roared with laughter,
for which the geologist saw no cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;allow me to remind you
of a line from Goldsmith&#8217;s &#8216;Deserted Village&#8217;:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;And the loud laugh that shows the empty mind.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Dewey muttered an excited &#8220;B&#8217;gee.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Dewey had been so awed by his companion&#8217;s learning that
he hadn&#8217;t told a story for an hour; but here the temptation
was too great.</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That reminds me of a story I once
heard. There was a fellow had a girl by the name of
Auburn. He wanted to write her a love poem, b&#8217;gee, and
he didn&#8217;t know how to begin. That poem&mdash;the &#8216;Deserted
Village&#8217;&mdash;begins:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, b&#8217;gee, this fellow thought that would do first rate
for a starter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wrote to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sweet Auburn, loveliest of the plain,&#8217; an&#8217; b&#8217;gee, she
wouldn&#8217;t speak to him for a month!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one joined in the laugh that followed except the
Parson; the Parson was still busily chipping rocks with
his &#8220;astrology&#8221; hammer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I find nothing,&#8221; he remarked, hesitatingly. &#8220;But I
see a most beautiful fern up in that cleft. It is a rhododendron,
of the species&mdash;&mdash;I cannot see it very clearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; observed Texas, gayly. &#8220;I want to hear the
rest of that air name. Don&#8217;t forget the first part&mdash;romeo&mdash;romeo
what?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>While he was talking Texas had laid hold of the projecting
cliff, and with a mighty effort swung himself up
on a ledge. Then he raised himself upon his toes and
stretched out to get that &#8220;rhododendron.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson, gazing up anxiously, saw him lay hold
of the plant to pull it off. And then, to his surprise, he
heard the Texan give vent to a surprised and excited
&#8220;Wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried the others.</p>

<p>Texas was too much interested to answer. They saw
him seize hold of a bush that grew above him and raise
himself up. Then he pushed aside the plants in front of
him and stared curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded the rest again.</p>

<p>And Texas gazed down at them excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, you!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Fellers, it&#8217;s a cave!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cave!&#8221; cried the others incredulously.</p>

<p>By way of answer Texas turned, faced the rock again,
and shouted a mighty &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>And to the inexpressible consternation of the crowd an
echo, loud and clear, responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a cave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>MYSTERIES GALORE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The excitement which resulted from Texas&#8217; amazing
discovery may be imagined. If he had found a &#8220;Megatherium,&#8221;
feet and all, there could not have been more interest.
Texas was dragged down by the legs, and then
there was a wild scramble among the rest, the &#8220;invalid&#8221;
excepted, to see who could get up there first and try the
echo.</p>

<p>The entrance, it seemed, was a narrow hole in the rock,
completely hidden by a growth of bushes and plants. And
the echo! What an amazing echo it was, to be sure! Not
only did it answer clearly, but it repeated, and muttered
again and again. It took parts of sentences and twisted
them about and made the strangest possible combinations
of sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be an enormous cave!&#8221; cried Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has probably fissures to a great distance,&#8221; observed
the geologist. &#8220;The freaks of water action are numerous.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>&#8220;I wonder if there&#8217;s room for a man to get in,&#8221; Mark
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ef there ain&#8217;t,&#8221; suggested Texas, &#8220;we kin force Indian
through to make it bigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indian shrank back in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooo!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go near it for a fortune.
Bless my soul, there may be bears or snakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last suggestion made Dewey, who was then peeping
in, drop down in a hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that. And
who knows but what a live Megatherium preserved from
the tertiary periods may come roaring out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had a light,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;Then we might
look in and see. I wonder if we couldn&#8217;t burn that book
the Parson has?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson hugged his beloved &#8220;Dana&#8217;s Geology&#8221; in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, severely, &#8220;I would rather you
burned me than this book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; cried Dewey. &#8220;You&#8217;re most as dry! But a
fellow couldn&#8217;t find a match for you, Parson, if he hunted
from now till doomsday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parson Stanard turned away with the grieved look he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
always wore when people got &#8220;frivolous.&#8221; But that mood
did not last long; they were all too excited in their strange
find to continue joking. They spent half an hour after
that peering in cautiously and seeing nothing but blackness.
Texas even had the nerve to stick one arm in, at
which the rest cried out in horror. Indian&#8217;s direful hint
of snakes or bears had its effect.</p>

<p>It took no small amount of daring to fool about that
mysterious black hole. Dewey, ever merry and teasing,
was keeping them all on pins and needles by being ceaselessly
reminded of grisly yarns. He told of a cave that
was full of rattlesnakes, &#8220;assorted sizes, all genuine and
no two alike, b&#8217;gee!&#8221; Of another that had been a robber&#8217;s
den with great red-faced, furious, black villains in it, to
say nothing of gleaming daggers. Of another, with pitfalls,
with water in them and no bottom, &#8220;though why the
water didn&#8217;t leak out of where the bottom wasn&#8217;t, b&#8217;gee,
I&#8217;m not able to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>It got to be very monotonous by and by, standing about
in idleness and curiosity, peeping and wondering what
was inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be a good idea for some one to go
in and find out,&#8221; suggested Mark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; gasped Indian. &#8220;I won&#8217;t, for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I for two, b&#8217;gee!&#8221; said Dewey, with especial emphasis.</p>

<p>The rest were just as hasty to decline. One look at
that black hole was enough to deter any one. But Mark,
getting more and more impatient at the delay, more and
more resolved to end that mystery, was slowly making up
his mind that he was not going to be deterred. And suddenly
he stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a &#8216;boost,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; echoed the six, in a breath. &#8220;Your arm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; responded he, with decision. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to find out what&#8217;s inside, and I&#8217;m going to hurry up
about it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean you&#8217;re going to crawl through that
hole?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Texas sprang forward with an excited look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Cuz I&#8217;m not going to let you!&#8221;</p>

<p>And before Mark could comprehend what he meant his
devoted friend had swung himself up to the ledge again,
and was already halfway in through the opening.</p>

<p>The others stared up at him anxiously. They saw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Southerner&#8217;s arms and head vanish, and then, while they
waited, prepared for almost anything horrible, they heard
an excited exclamation. A moment later the head reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Texas. &#8220;Fellers, there&#8217;s a ladder in
thar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ladder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sah! That&#8217;s what I said, a ladder! A rope one!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the head disappeared; the body followed
wriggling. Then with startling suddenness the feet and
legs flew in, and an instant afterward, to the horror of
the frightened crowd, there was a heavy crash.</p>

<p>Mark made a leap for the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; they heard the bold Texan growl, his voice
sounding hollow and muffled. &#8220;The ole ladder busted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooo!&#8221; gasped Indian. &#8220;Are you dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas did not condescend to answer that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some o&#8217; you fellers come in hyar now!&#8221; he roared.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to stay alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it like in there?&#8221; inquired Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see,&#8221; answered the other&#8217;s muffled voice. &#8220;Only
it&#8217;s a floor like, an&#8217;, say, it&#8217;s got carpet!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;A carpet!&#8221; fairly gasped those outside. &#8220;A carpet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in and see,&#8221; exclaimed Mark. &#8220;Help me
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest &#8220;boosted&#8221; him with a will. With his one free
arm he managed to worm his way through the opening,
and then Texas seized him and pulled him through. After
that the others followed with alacrity. Even Indian
finally got up the &#8220;nerve,&#8221; though loudly bemoaning his
fate; he didn&#8217;t want to come, but it was worse out there
all alone in the woods.</p>

<p>Coming in from the brilliant sunlight they were blind as
bats. They could not detect the faintest shade of difference
in the darkness, and they stood huddled together
timidly, not even daring to grope about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us remove ourselves further from the light,&#8221; suggested
the Parson, ever learned. &#8220;Then we may get used
to the darkness, for the retina of the visual organ has
the power of accommodating itself to a decrease in intensity
of the illuminating&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They prepared to obey the suggestion, without waiting
for the conclusion of the discourse. But moving in that
chasm was indeed a fearful task. In the first place, there
were possible wells, so the Parson said, though the presence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of the mysterious carpet made that improbable. The
first thing Mark had done when he reached bottom was to
stoop and verify his friend&#8217;s amazing statement. And he
found that it was just as the other had said. There was
carpet, and it was a soft, fine carpet, too.</p>

<p>What that could mean they scarcely dared to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody must live here,&#8221; whispered Mark. &#8220;And
they can hardly be honest people, hiding in a place like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>That did not tend to make the moving about any more
pleasant. They caught hold of each other, though there
was little comfort in that, for each found that his neighbors
were trembling as much as himself. Then, step by
step (and very small steps) they advanced, groping in
front with their hands, and feeling the ground in front
of them with their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; gasped Indian. &#8220;There might be a
trapdoor!&#8221;</p>

<p>That grewsome and ghastly suggestion caused so much
terror that it stopped all further progress for a minute at
least, and when finally they did go on, it was with still
more frightened and thumping hearts.</p>

<p>They took two or three more steps ahead; and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
suddenly Mark, who was a trifle in the lead, sprang back
with a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; gasped the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something, I
don&#8217;t know what. I touched it!&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood in a huddled group, straining their eyes to
pierce the darkness. It was horrible to know that something
was there, and not to know what. One might imagine
anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Megatherium,&#8221; whispered Dewey, irrepressible
even here.</p>

<p>In the suspense that followed the frightened crowd
made out that Mark was leaning forward to explore with
one hand.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, with a cry of real horror this time,
he forced them back hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alive!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>They were about ready to drop dead with terror by that
time, or to scatter and run for their lives. Every one of
them was wishing he had never thought of entering this
grewsome, black place, with its awful mysteries, its possibilities
of fierce beasts or still more fierce and lawless men,
or ghosts and goblins, or Heaven only knew what else.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Most men do not believe in ghosts or goblins until they
get into just some situation like this.</p>

<p>Indian was moaning in terror most appalling, and the
rest were in but little better state of mind. And then suddenly
the Parson uttered a subdued exclamation. They
turned with him and saw what he meant. Facing the
darkness as they had, when they turned in the direction
of the light that streamed in from the opening, they found
that they really could begin to see. But how? The light
was so dim and gray that it only made things worse. The
seven saw all kinds of horrible shadows about them, above
them, beneath them, and not one single object could they
distinguish to allay their fears.</p>

<p>Still huddled together, still silent and trembling, they
stood and gazed about them, waiting. There was not a
sound but the beating of their own hearts until all of a
sudden Dewey was heard to whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee, I&#8217;ve got a match!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fumbling in his pockets for a moment he brought that
precious object out, while the others crowded about him
anxiously. A match! A match! They could hardly believe
their ears. Robinson Crusoe never welcomed that
tiny object more gratefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>With fear and trembling Dewey prepared to light it.
Every one of them dreaded the moment; horrible though
the darkness was, it might be a black shroud for yet more
horrible things.</p>

<p>Mark caught him by the arm just as he was in the act
of doing it; but it was not for that reason. He suggested
that they have papers ready to keep that precious fire going.
It was a good idea, and proved so popular that the
Parson, filled with a spirit of self-sacrifice, even tore out
the blank title pages of his Dana to contribute. And then
at last Dewey struck the light.</p>

<p>The match was a good one fortunately. It flickered and
sputtered a moment, seeming to hesitate about burning,
while the lads gasped in suspense. Then suddenly it
flared up brightly, and they gazed about them in dread.</p>

<small>A HORRIBLE DISCOVERY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>What a lot of grewsomeness a little match can remove,
to be sure! This one did not solve the mysteries of that
wondrous cave, but it removed most of the horror of the
explorers. It showed, for instance, that the furry thing
which Mark had vowed was alive was an ordinary plush-covered
chair!</p>

<p>The seven had no time to laugh at that; they were too
busy staring. The feeble light could not reach to the
other end of the long vista they saw, and neither could
one of the papers they hastily lit. But it gave them one
glimpse of a most amazing scene.</p>

<p>This cave was indeed a surprising place. The carpet
they saw covered nearly all of the floor. There were
chairs scattered about, and other articles of furniture.
There were some curtains draped from the rocky walls.
There were swinging lamps from the vaulted roof. Down
in the dim distance there was even a table&mdash;a table with
shining white dishes upon it. And then the light began
to flicker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>Quick as a flash Mark seized it and sprang toward one
of the lamps. He was just in time. He whipped off the
shade and touched the wick. A moment later they were
standing in a brilliant, clear light, that shone to the
farthest depths of the place.</p>

<p>The seven bold plebes stood in the center beneath the
lamp, perfectly amazed by what they saw. The same idea
was flashing across the minds of all of them. This splendor
must belong to some one! Those dishes up there were
set for a meal! And the owner&mdash;where was he? Suppose
he should come and find them there? Indian cast a
longing glance at the opening that led to freedom outside.</p>

<p>Probably the wisest course for them would have been
precipitate flight. To be trapped in there by desperate
men would be terrible indeed! But curiosity urged them
on. This was a glorious mystery&mdash;a mystery worth solving.
It was almost a fairy tale; an enchanted princess
alone was needed.</p>

<p>Now, whether they would have been bold enough to
stay and look about them, had it not been for one occurrence,
it is impossible to say. Texas, glancing curiously
about him, caught sight of a familiar object on a bench to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
one side, and he leaped forward and seized it. He stared
at it hastily and gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>It was a revolver! A forty-four calibre, and it was
loaded, too!</p>

<p>No power on earth could have moved Texas then; he
had a gun; he was at home after that, and he feared
neither man nor devil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em come!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to look.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode forward, Mark at his side, and the rest following,
peering into every nook and cranny.</p>

<p>One thing seemed certain. There was no one about.
The cave had all sorts of passageways and corners, but
hunt as they would they saw not a soul, heard not a
sound. The place was like a tomb. It was just as silent
and weird and uncanny, and moreover just as moldy and
dusty as the tomb is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mark examined the table with its queer outlay of dishes.
They were all covered with dust; several had tops, and
when Mark lifted them he found that they, too, were
empty but for that. It seemed as if dust were everywhere.</p>

<p>Mark was recalled from his interesting exploration by
an excited &#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; from Dewey. Dewey was staring at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the wall, and as the others ran up to him he pointed without
a word in front of him. There was a calendar hanging
there. And plain as day, the inscription was still&mdash;Tuesday,
May the eighteenth, eighteen hundred and
forty-eight!</p>

<p>The seven were too mystified by that to say a word.
They stared at each other in silence, and then went on.</p>

<p>The next thing to attract their attention was a long
workbench at one side. Mark wondered how that thing
could ever have come in by the opening, until he saw a
box of tools at one side, which suggested that it might
have been built inside. There were all sorts of strange
looking tools upon the bench, and molds, and dies, and
instruments which none of them recognized. Nearby was
a forge and a small pair of bellows, a pot of once molten
metal, now cold and dust-covered, stood beside it; there
were bars, too, of what the puzzled crowd took to be lead.</p>

<p>It was left to the all-wise Parson to discover what this
meant. The Parson picked up one of the dies he saw upon
the table. He gazed at it curiously, blowing away the
dust and cleaning the metal. Then, muttering to himself
excitedly, he stepped over to one side of the cave
where soft clay was on the floor, and seizing some, pressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
it into the mold. He held it before his horrified companions,
a perfect image of the United States half dollar;
and he spoke but two words of explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;counterfeiters!&#8221;</p>

<p>The amount of excitement which that caused may be
readily imagined. A counterfeiter&#8217;s den! And they were
in it! Texas clutched his revolver the tighter and stared
about him warily. As for poor Indian, he simply sat down
upon the floor and collapsed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; said Mark at last. &#8220;I say we finish examining
this place and get out. I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>None of them did, and they did not hesitate to say so,
either. Nothing but curiosity, and the fact that they were
ashamed to show their fear, kept them from running for
all they were worth. As it was, their advance was timid
and hesitating.</p>

<p>They were almost at the end of the cave then. They
could see the walls sloping together and the ceiling sloping
down toward the floor. The light of the lamp was
far away and dim then, and they could not see very
clearly. But one thing they did make out to their surprise
and alarm. The end of that cave was a heavy iron door,
shut tight!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>There was but one idea flashed over the minds of every
one of the seven at that moment. The money! Here was
where the men kept it, in that firmly locked safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; muttered Dewey. &#8220;I say we go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of them wanted to, and in a hurry. But there
were two of them that didn&#8217;t mean to; one was the venturesome
and reckless Texas, and the other was Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I came in,&#8221; said the latter calmly. &#8220;But
since I&#8217;m here I&#8217;m going to see the thing to the end. I&#8217;m
going to search this cave and find out what the whole
business means. Who&#8217;ll help me open that door?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Banded Seven weren&#8217;t timid by a long shot. They
had dared more desperate deeds than any plebes West
Point had ever seen. But in this black hole of mystery,
suggestive of desperate criminals and no one knew what
else, it was no wonder that they hesitated. There was no
one but Texas cared to venture near that shadowy door.</p>

<p>Mark himself was by no means as cool as he seemed.
He had made up his mind to explore the cave, and he
meant to do it, but he chose to hurry all the same. He
stepped quickly forward, peering anxiously into the
shadows as he did so. And a moment later his hand
was upon the door knob.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>He shook it vigorously, but found that it was firmly
set. It reminded him of the door of a safe, for it had a
solid, heavy &#8220;feel,&#8221; and it closed with a spring lock, having
no key. Mark noticed that as he was debating with
himself whether or not to open it; and then suddenly he
gave the knob a mighty wrench and pulled with all his
might upon the door.</p>

<p>The knob was rusty, and so were the complicated
hinges. The door finally gave way, however, with a creak
that was dismal and suggestive. The others shrank back
instinctively as the black space it disclosed yawned in front
of them.</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s heart was beating furiously as he glanced
around to peer in. A musty, close odor caught his attention,
and then as the faint light made its way in, he saw
that beyond was still another compartment, seemingly
blacker, and certainly more mysterious than the first. But
Mark hesitated not a moment; he had made up his mind
to enter and he did. Texas, who was at his back, taking
hold of the door to hold it.</p>

<p>Those outside waited for but one moment, a moment
of anxious suspense and dread. They had seen their
leader&#8217;s figure vanish, swallowed up in the blackness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the place. They were wondering, tremblingly, as to what
the result would be; and then suddenly came a result so
terrible and unexpected that it nearly knocked them down.
It was a scream, a wild shriek of horror, and it came from
Mark!</p>

<p>The six outside gazed at each other, ready to faint from
fright; Texas, startled, too, by the weirdness of the tone,
sprang back involuntarily. And in an instant the heavy
iron door, released from his hand, swung inward and
slammed with a dismal clang that rang and echoed down
the long, vaulted cave.</p>

<p>The noise was succeeded by a silence that was yet more
terrible; not another sound came from Mark, to tell that
he was alive or what. And for just an instant, paralyzed
with fright, the horror-stricken cadets stood motionless,
staring blankly at the glistening door. And then Texas
sprang forward to the rescue. He seized the knob furiously,
and tearing at the barrier with all his strength,
flung it wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Follow me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas was clutching the revolver, a desperate look upon
his face; the others, horrified though they were, sprang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
forward to his side ready to dare anything for the sake of
Mark.</p>

<p>But there was no need of their entering. As the light
shone in the whole scene was plainly in view. And the six
stared with ever-increasing awe. Leaning against the
wall, where he had staggered back, was Mark; his face
was as white as a sheet; one trembling hand was raised,
pointing across the compartment. And the rest followed
the direction with their eyes, and then started back in no
less horror, their faces even paler than his. Lying flat
upon the floor, shining out in the blackness white and distinct
and ghastly, their hollow eyes fixed in a death stare
upon the roof, were six horrible, grinning skeletons.</p>

<p>Awe-stricken, those reckless plebes stood motionless,
gazing upon the scene. They were too dumfounded to
say a word, almost to think. And then suddenly, as one
man, moved by a single impulse, they faced about and stole
silently out of the place. The iron door clanged once
more, and then, still silent, the plebes marched in Indian
file down the long corridor to where the sunlight
streamed in; helped each other out through the narrow
opening; and finally, free at last, drew a long breath of
inexpressible relief under the clear blue sky of heaven.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>It was some minutes after that even before they said a
word. Finally Mark spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a mystery. Who can solve
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson heaved a sigh and raised his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were once,&#8221; he began, &#8220;six counterfeiters, who
did their work in a lonely cave. That cave had two entrances,
one of which we know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other lies at the end of the passageway,&#8221; said
Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a way of escape,&#8221; went on the Parson, &#8220;in case
the other entrance was discovered by outsiders. But subsequently
that entrance became blocked&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they were caught in their own trap,&#8221; finished
Mark. &#8220;That door slammed as it did on me, and they
were suffocated. And that is all. Let us go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still awe-stricken and silent, the rest arose and started
to follow him. But suddenly Texas, the excitable, irrelevant
Texas, stopped and began to gasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Fellers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye know I never thought of it! That air cave is
our&#8217;n!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any one else to own it, that&#8217;s what I mean.
An&#8217; ef ever we want a place to hide in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or haze yearlings in,&#8221; came from Dewey.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ours!&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;Just the thing! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<small>A JOKE ON THE PARSON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mark did not lose any time in telling Grace Fuller all
about the cave.</p>

<p>He called on her at the West Point Hotel, where she
boarded with her father, and found her sitting on the
piazza.</p>

<p>&#8220;A real cave!&#8221; she cried, with a smile. &#8220;How romantic!
Have you told&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody but you,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;It&#8217;s our secret. We
may want to haze some yearlings there, you know. So not
a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you say it was furnished! How wonderful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;even carpets. It seems that this
place was once the den of a gang of counterfeiters. I see
you open your eyes in surprise. We found all their dies
and molds and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how do you know they aren&#8217;t there still?&#8221; inquired
Grace Fuller in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the grewsome part of the story. They are all
dead. We found that the cave was divided by a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
iron door. I went into the other part and the door
slammed and shut me in. I was scared almost to death,
far more than I was the day I swam out to help you. The
rest of the fellows opened it at last, and I found that I was
shut in with six skeletons. I don&#8217;t wonder you look horrified.
Those criminals had been trapped accidentally in
their own cave, just as I was, but they had been suffocated.
And there they had lain, we found out afterward,
for forty or fifty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfectly terrible!&#8221; gasped the girl, her cheeks
pale. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you will ever dare go into the
place again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a big temptation,&#8221; laughed Mark. &#8220;You see if
the cadets continue to try unfair tactics in their efforts to
haze us poor unfortunate plebes we can scare some of
them into submission up there. And besides, our learned
Boston friend, Parson Stanard, has gotten the gold fever.
He vows he&#8217;s going on a treasure hunt in that cave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A treasure hunt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You see it&#8217;s probable those men had some
money, to say nothing of all the bad money they made.
And it&#8217;ll be a case of &#8216;finding&#8217;s keepings.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Grace, thoughtfully. And then suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
she broke into one of her merry, ringing laughs, that
compelled Mark to join.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the Parson&#8217;s such a queer old chap!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he comical? He&#8217;s so solemn and learned. I can
just imagine him prying all about that cave, the same
way he does for his fossils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never shall forget the day I first met the Parson,&#8221;
responded Mark. &#8220;It was when we were just getting up
the Banded Seven to try to stop the hazing. The yearlings
had tied his long, bony frame in a sack. He had
gotten out and chased the whole crowd of them about
the parade ground. And he came into my room in barracks
perfectly furious with indignation. Yea, by Zeus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He found out I was interested in geology,&#8221; said Grace.
&#8220;I studied it once, and he&#8217;s never ceased to give me lectures
since he found that out. And I never hear anything
nowadays but shistose slates, and sandstone conglomerates,
and triassic eras, and orohippusses and pertodactyles
and brontotheriums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gives us long discourses over in camp, too,&#8221;
laughed Mark. &#8220;I can see his lank, bony figure now. It
was more comical still when he wore his &#8216;geology coat,&#8217;
with huge coat tails and pockets for fossils. Anyhow, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
gets very much worked up when he&#8217;s telling us about the
glories of geology. And poor Dewey, who&#8217;s such an inveterate
joker, always has to get into trouble by interrupting
him. Yesterday, for instance, the Parson was
telling us about seashores. He didn&#8217;t see how any one
could fail to appreciate what a wonderful thing a beach
was. Here was being written a record that men might
read millions of years later. It would be hardened then
into imperishable stone. Here, for instance, was the
track of a bird. Little by little sand would be scattered
over it; more sand on top of that; and so on until it was
crushed into rock. That is the way all sandstones are
made. Huge convulsions of earth would bring that up
to the surface; men would find it, break it open, and there
the track of the bird! Wonder of wonders!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mark paused for breath, and began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Dewey say?&#8221; inquired Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to know if the Parson would classify the
summer girl as a bird. He said he&#8217;d seen lots of their
tracks on the beach. Then he wanted to know if a learned
geologist could tell the track of a Chicago girl from that
of a Boston girl. Then he went on to imagine the contents
of a Coney Island sandstone. The Parson had told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
of Megatheriums&#8217; bones and teeth and skeletons. Dewey
wanted to know how about empty sarsaparilla bottles and
peanut shells, and tickets to the Turkish dancers and
Shoot the Chutes, and popcorn balls, and frankfurters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the Parson say?&#8221; laughed the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he just said something about being &#8216;frivolous.&#8217;
But the climax came a few minutes later when the Parson
told how Cavier and other famous scientists had become
so wondrously learned that they could tell what an
animal was from the tiniest bit of its skeleton, its frame,
as he called it. And that started Dewey. He put on his
most serious face and told us how he&#8217;d read of a great
mystery, a geologist who had found the frame of an animal
hard as iron, and almost smashed to pieces in some
rocks. There was what looked like the body of a man
lying near. The first-mentioned thing, so Dewey said,
had eighteen teeth in front and seven behind. And the
geologist didn&#8217;t know what on earth it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark interrupted himself here long enough to indulge
in a little silent laughter, and then he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the Parson took it seriously. He put on his
most learned air, and looked it up in &#8216;Dana,&#8217; his beloved
geological text-book. &#8216;Eighteen in front and seven behind?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
The rear ones must be molars. Probably, then, it
was a Pal&aelig;othere, but they were extinct before prim&aelig;val
man appears. And it couldn&#8217;t be one of the Zenglodons,
and surely not a Plesiosaurus. Oh, yes! Why, of course,
it must be an Ichthyornis!&#8217; And the Parson was smiles
all over. &#8216;How stupid of that geologist not to have
guessed it! An Ichthyornis!&#8217; But then Dewey said no, it
wasn&#8217;t. &#8216;Then what is it?&#8217; cried the Parson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; laughed Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said it was a &#8217;97 model, seventy-two gear, and the
rider had coasted down the hill on it. The teeth weren&#8217;t
molars, they were sprockets. Somebody yelled &#8216;Bicycle!&#8217;
and the Parson wouldn&#8217;t speak to him all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s merry laughter over the story was pleasant
to hear; it was a great deal more pleasant to Mark than
the original incident had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a shame to fool him so,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;The
Parson is so solemn and dignified. And it hurts his
feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gets over it all,&#8221; laughed Mark, &#8220;and then he enjoys
it, too, else we wouldn&#8217;t do it; for every one of us
likes our old geological genius. I don&#8217;t see what we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
should do without him. He knows everything under the
sun, I&#8217;m sure, especially about fossils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to fool him,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>Mark chuckled softly to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That remark of yours just reminds me of something
else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Banded Seven have put up a job to
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to fool the Parson, you mean?&#8221; cried Grace.</p>

<p>By way of answer Mark fumbled under his jacket
where the girl had noticed a peculiar lump. He drew
forth a bit of stone and handed it to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you call that?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks for all the world like a fossil,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we all thought. Dewey
found it, and it fooled him. He thought it was the bone
of a Megatherium, or one of those outlandish beasts. We
were going to give it to the Parson, only I had the luck
to recognize it. It&#8217;s nothing but a bit of a porcelain jug.
And then Dewey suggested that we try it on him, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see how it goes with the Parson,&#8221; responded
Grace, with a laugh. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d try it while
I&#8217;m around.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>The two as they had been talking were gazing across
from the piazza in the direction of the summer encampment
of the corps. And suddenly the girl gave an exclamation
of surprise, as she noticed a tall, long-legged
figure leave the camp, and proceed with great strides
across the parade ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he goes now!&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>Mark put his fingers to his lips and gave a shrill whistle.
The Parson faced about and stared around anxiously;
then, as he saw a handkerchief waving to him from the
hotel, he turned and strode in that direction. A minute
later his solemn face was gazing up at the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I dare not come up there.
No, tempt me not. The little volume of instructions designated
as the Blue Book denies the pleasure of visiting
the hotel without a permit. I fear exceedingly lest I be
violating some regulation by standing so near the forbidden
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite used to getting permits to visit here,&#8221;
laughed Mark. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll order them by the wholesale
soon, that is if Miss Fuller stays much longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; Mark added, whispering to the girl, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
noticed the Parson edging off. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I can make him
break a rule and come up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; inquired the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parson! Oh, Parson!&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;Come up here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tempt me not!&#8221; protested Stanard. &#8220;The danger is
great and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a fossil to show you,&#8221; called the other.</p>

<p>The Parson stared incredulously for a moment at the
object Mark held up. He suspected a ruse. But no, it
was a fossil! And oblivious to duty, danger, demerits
and all the rest of the universe, he gave a leap, dashed
up the stairs, and fairly pounced upon the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fossil!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;By the immortal gods, a fossil!
Yea, by Zeus, let me see it.&#8221;</p>

<small>STANARD&#8217;S DEFIANCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The Parson seemed about ready to devour that &#8220;fossil.&#8221;
He seized it and plumped himself down in a chair with a
thud. He paused just long enough to deposit his &#8220;Dana&#8221;
upon the floor, and to draw up his learned trousers to the
high-water mark, disclosing his pale, sea-green socks.
And then with a preliminary &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; and several blinks
he raised the precious relic and stared at it.</p>

<p>The two conspirators were watching him gleefully, occasionally
exchanging sly glances. The Parson, all oblivious
of this, surveyed one side of the fossil and then turned
it over. He tapped it on the arm of his chair; he picked
at it with his finger nail; he even tasted it, with scientific
public-spiritedness and zeal. And then he cleared his
throat solemnly and looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;er&mdash;that is&mdash;ladies&mdash;this is a
most interesting specimen we have here. I regret that
with the brief analysis possible to me I cannot classify it
as I should like. A microscopic examination would be
undoubtedly essential for that. But some things I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
say. This is evidently a fossil bone, a portion of the
thigh bone, I should say, probably of some gigantic animal
like the Ichthyosaurus. As you will notice from the
compactness of the structure and the heaviness, it is much
solidified, thus indicating a very remote age, probably the
upper Cretaceous at the very least, or possibly the Silurian.
I am not able to say positively because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson stopped and gazed about him with a surprised
and rather injured air. Really the rudeness of
some people was amazing! Here were the two he was
talking to actually leaning back in their chairs and giving
vent to peals of laughter, what about he had no idea.
This was really too much!</p>

<p>It was at least five minutes before either Mark or his
companion could manage to stop long enough to explain
to the puzzled geologist that he had been classifying a
porcelain jug. And when they did and he realized it he
sat back in his chair and gazed at them in utter consternation.
He never said one word for at least a minute;
he simply stared, while the idea slowly percolated through
his mind. Grace Fuller, ever kind-hearted and considerate,
had begun to fear that he was angry, and then suddenly
the Boston scholar leaned back in his chair, opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
his classic mouth, and forth therefrom came a roar of
laughter that made the sentries away over by camp start
in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho, ho!&#8221; shouted he. &#8220;Ho, ho! ha, ha! he, he! A
jug! Yea, by Zeus, a jug! By the nine immortals, a
jug!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark stared at him in undisguised amazement. During
all his acquaintance with that solemn scholar, he had
never seen such an earthquake of a laugh as that. And
evidently, too, the Parson was not used to it, for when
he stopped he was so out of breath and red in the face
that he could hardly move.</p>

<p>And that was the first, last, one and only time that
Parson Stanard was ever known to laugh. It took a
peculiar sort of a joke to move the Parson.</p>

<p>It took also quite an amount of sputtering and gasping
to restore the gentleman&#8217;s throat and lungs to their ordinary
normal condition. That spasm of hilarity which had
plowed its way through him like a mighty ship through
the waves had left little ripples and gurgles of laughter
which bubbled forth occasionally for the next ten minutes
at least. It passed, however, at last, to return no more,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and Parson Stanard was the same, solemn and learned
Parson as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;er&mdash;that is&mdash;ahem&mdash;ladies&mdash;that
was indeed a most extraordinary blunder for a student of
geology to make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It fooled us all,&#8221; said Grace, consolingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; responded he, with crushing severity. &#8220;That
was to be expected. But one who has pursued the science
as the study of his life should not thus be deceived. Gentlemen,
I am tired of being fooled, yea, by Zeus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; inquired Mark, &#8220;that you want us to
stop playing jokes on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark had been a little conscience-stricken during that
last prank. He expected the Parson to answer his question
in the affirmative, and he meant in all seriousness to
agree to stop. But the Parson&#8217;s answer was different.
His professional pride had been awakened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean nothing of the kind!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I mean that
I no longer mean to let you. I mean that a man who
has so long resisted and outwitted our enemy, the yearlings,
ought now to be beyond deception. I will no more
be fooled!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>There was quite an exciting adventure destined to
grow out of that scholarly defiance, an adventure that
none of those present had the least suspicion of then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; inquired Mark, laughingly, &#8220;that you
defy the Banded Seven to fool you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, by Zeus!&#8221; said the Parson, emphatically. &#8220;And
I mean not only geologically, but in any other way whatsoever,
logically or illogically.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark chuckled softly to himself at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try it some day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a chance
to forget it meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said nothing more about it then, and a minute or
so later the Parson arose to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Gentlemen&mdash;er&mdash;that is&mdash;ladies&mdash;I
bid you good-afternoon. I really fear to incur further
risk by yielding to the charms of the siren&#8217;s voice. Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark and the girl sat in silence and watched his ungainly
figure stride away down the path; and suddenly she
fell to laughing merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Parson&#8217;s dignity is insulted,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He is
getting bold and defiant.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>&#8220;And I see room for no end of fun just there,&#8221; responded
Mark. &#8220;I had an inspiration a few moments ago,
watching him. And I have a perfectly fascinating plot
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; inquired Grace, &#8220;that you are going
to take his challenge up so soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I do,&#8221; laughed Mark. &#8220;I mean to
do it this very night, before he&#8217;s expecting it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you a few moments ago, didn&#8217;t I, that the Parson
was excited over the possibility of finding a treasure?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was staring at Mark with a look of interest
and curiosity. That single hint was enough for her
quick-witted mind, and her beautiful face was lit up with
excitement in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeminy!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s so! Oo! Let me help,
won&#8217;t you? We&#8217;ll fool the Parson with a treasure!&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next half hour those two conspirators, completely
oblivious of everything, just sat and whispered
and chuckled. They were off in a lonely corner with no
one to overhear them, and they put their heads together
and concocted schemes by the bushel, getting more and
more excited and hilarious every moment. And then suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Mark sprang up with a cry of delight, said good-by
in a hurry and rushed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell the rest of the Seven!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;This
is too good to keep! And oh, say, if we can work it!
Whoop!&#8221;</p>

<small>STANARD&#8217;S STRANGE VISITOR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Dress parade, which took place immediately after the
above occupied the time until supper. It was growing
dark by the time the battalion marched back from mess
hall, and the plebes sighed and realized that one more
Saturday half holiday was gone. Parson Stanard, with
whom we have to do at present, looked around for his
fellow members as soon as the plebe company broke ranks.
He found to his surprise that they had disappeared suddenly,
gone he knew not where. They had gone to put
into execution the plot to fool him, but Stanard did not
know it. He turned and strolled away by himself in the
gathering dusk.</p>

<p>Near Trophy Point, just west of the camp, stands Battle
Monument. North of it stretches one of the finest
views that the Hudson Valley affords, a winding river
reaching the horizon&#8217;s end with the mountains of the
Highlands sloping to its very shores. The Parson liked
that view especially at this &#8220;hour of peace.&#8221; The Parson
was wont to preach long sermons to himself upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
sublimity of nature and the insignificance of man, etc.,
whenever he walked out there. And so now he seated
himself in a quiet nook and soon forgot where he was
and everything else about himself.</p>

<p>Others knew where he was, however, and from a safe
distance were eying his meditative form. It got darker
and darker, stars began to come out one by one, and the
moon began to turn from white to golden. All this was
lost upon the solitary philosopher, who would probably
have remained hidden in his own thoughts until tattoo
sounded, had it not been for one unpleasant interruption.</p>

<p>Now the Parson did not like to be interrupted; he
looked up with an obvious expression of annoyance, when
he became aware of the fact that a figure was approaching
him, had stopped and was staring at him. But when
the Parson surveyed the figure, he forgot to be annoyed,
for it was a very peculiar-looking figure, and moreover
it was acting very peculiarly too.</p>

<p>From what the Parson could see of him in the darkness
he was an old pack peddler. His figure was bent and
stooping, and he bore upon his back a heavy load. As to
his face, it was so covered by a growth of heavy black
hair and beard that the Parson could see nothing but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
pair of twinkling eyes. Such was the man; to the Parson&#8217;s
infinite amazement he was setting down his pack
and preparing to display his wares to him&mdash;to him, the
refined and cultured Boston scholar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoe laces, suspenders?&#8221; muttered the curious creature,
in a low, disagreeable voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said the other, emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matches, collar buttons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; cried the Parson, this time angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Socks, combs, brushes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hairpins, needles, necklaces?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I don&#8217;t want anything!&#8221; exclaimed the cadet.
&#8220;You disturb my meditations, yea, by Zeus, exceedingly!
I have no money. I don&#8217;t want anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>The strange old man paid not the least attention to
these emphatic and scholarly remonstrances. He was still
fumbling at his pack, about to display the contents. And
so the Parson, who was exceedingly provoked at having
been interrupted in a most valuable train of thought, seeing
the man was persistent, sprang up and started to
hurry away in disgust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>And then suddenly he was brought to a halt again, completely,
as much startled as if he had been shot through
the back. For the old man had raised his voice commandingly
and called aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Completely mystified and not a little alarmed by that
extraordinary act, the Parson turned and stared at the
weird figure. The peddler was still bent half to the
ground, but he had flung back his bushy head and extended
his hand in a gesture of command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&mdash;why!&#8221; stammered the amazed cadet. &#8220;By
Zeus!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man continued to stand, his piercing eyes
flashing. And then suddenly he dropped his hand and
in a low, singsong voice began to mumble, as if to himself.
His very first words rooted the Parson to the spot
in amazement and horror.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Deep within a mountain dreary</div>
<div class="indent">Lies a cavern old and dark;</div>
<div class="verse">Where the bones of men lie bleaching</div>
<div class="indent">In a chamber, cold and stark.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The Parson had turned as white as any bones; he was
gasping, staring at the horrible creature, who knew the
secret that the Parson had thought was his friends&#8217; alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
to tell. His consternation it is difficult to imagine; the
crouching figure saw it, and took advantage of it instantly.
Without making another sound, he backed away;
beckoning, the Parson following instinctively, helplessly.
They stood beneath the protecting shadow of some high
bushes, and there once more the weird figure raised his
arms, and the amazed cadet quailed and listened:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8217;Twas a secret not for mortals</div>
<div class="indent">Hidden by that cavern walls</div>
<div class="verse">For beyond those gloomy portals&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;In the name of all that is holy!&#8221; cried the Parson,
suddenly. &#8220;By the nine Olympians, by the nine Heliconian
muses, I abjure you! By the three Cyclos, by the
three Centimani, the three Fates, the three Furies, the
three Graces! By Acheron and the Styx! By the Pillars
of Hercules and the Palladium of Troy. By all that men
can mention, yea, by Zeus, I demand to know how you
learned this!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson gasped after that; and the old man went on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Silence, rash, presumptuous mortal,</div>
<div class="indent">Seekest thou the Fates to know?</div>
<div class="verse">At whose word e&#8217;en Zeus doth tremble,</div>
<div class="indent">Sun and earth and moon below.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was nothing like a classical allusion to awe the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Parson; convinced of the strange man&#8217;s superiority, then,
he dared not a word more.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The old man stopped abruptly. The amazed cadet was
staring at him in the utmost consternation. And then
suddenly the man raised his hand again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Parson followed his finger; it was pointing to the
camp; and hesitating but a moment more Stanard turned
and started away, his brain reeling so that he could
hardly walk, his ears still echoing the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>He never once turned to look back at that mysterious
figure. If he had he might have been more surprised than
ever. For the figure, hiding behind the bush, flung off
its pack, stepped out of the old man&#8217;s rags, tore off a
heavy false beard and wig and emerged&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mark Mallory!</p>

<p>He whistled once, and a drum orderly, bribed for the
occasion, ran out and hurried off with the things. And
Mark rushed over and burst into a group of cadets that
stood near.</p>

<p>&#8220;It worked! It worked!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Oh, you should
have seen how it took him in! And he&#8217;ll go as sure as
we&#8217;re alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just then tattoo sounded and the six villains set
out on a run for the camp.</p>

<p>Now Parson Stanard&#8217;s scholarly features were solemn
enough under any circumstances; when there was anything
to make them still more so he was a sight to behold.
This was the case that evenings for the Parson, when he
fell into line, was looking as if the future destiny of the
universe were resting upon his shoulders, and his hilarious
comrades were scarcely able to keep from bursting into
laughter every time they glanced at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>He was too busy with his own thoughts to notice them,
however. He was so much occupied by speculations
upon the mystery of that weird old man that he forgot
for a moment to answer to his name at roll call, and had
to be poked in the ribs to wake him up. Then the line
melted away, and still solemn he marched into his tent
and gathered his &#8220;wondering&#8221; fellow-devils about him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have a tale to tell you. I have
this day, this very hour, met with an adventure, preternatural
or supernatural, that exceeds the capacities of the
human intellectualities to appreciate. Gentlemen, I am
no believer in signs or auguries; but never did the oracle
of Delphi or the Sibyl of Cumea promulgate a prophecy
more extraordinary than one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried the six, in obvious
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seen a ghost?&#8221; inquired Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, gentlemen,&#8221; said the Parson. &#8220;But I have seen
some one or something that I should be glad to know
was a ghost, something more marvelous than any hitherto
recorded, spiritualistic manifestation. And I am sorely
perplexed.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this and a little more of similar introduction the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Parson finally managed to get down to business and tell
to his horrified (oh, yes!) companions the tale of his
adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say look a-here, Parson,&#8221; demanded Texas, when he
had finished, &#8220;you expect us to believe that aire yarn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say!&#8221; added Mark. &#8220;He&#8217;s trying to
fool us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; protested the other, &#8220;do I look like a
man who was joking?&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t for a fact; he looked like a man who had
been through a flour mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that don&#8217;t make any difference,&#8221; vowed Mark.
&#8220;You&#8217;re just putting on thet face to help deceive us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Zeus!&#8221; exclaimed the Parson. &#8220;Gentlemen, I
swear to you that I am serious. I swear it by the bones
of my grandfather. I swear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it grandmother,&#8221; hinted Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear it by the poisons of Colchia,&#8221; continued the
other indignantly. &#8220;By the waters of the Styx, by the
sands of the Pactolus, by the spells of Medea, by the
thunderbolts of Jove, by the sandals of Mercury&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson would probably have continued swearing
by everything known to mythology, keeping up until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
&#8220;taps&#8221; stopped him. But by that time the conspirators
saw fit to believe him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an extraordinary state of affairs,&#8221; said Mark,
solemnly. &#8220;Really, fellows, do you know I think we
ought to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee, so do I,&#8221; cried Dewey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was about to extend you an invitation,&#8221; said the
Parson. &#8220;For my part I am determined to go this very
night. Nothing shall stop me, gentlemen. My mind is
made up. That treasure, revealed to me under such circumstances,
I am determined to secure, and that in spite of
whatever dangers I may meet, whatever foes may oppose
me, whatever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for the Parson!&#8221; whispered Texas. &#8220;He&#8217;s gittin&#8217;
spunky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are by no means the first,&#8221; said the solemn scholar,
&#8220;to undertake a dangerous search for wealth. The
ancient poets sang of Jason and the Argonauts and the
Search for the Golden Fleece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This yere&#8217;s the biggest golden &#8216;fleece&#8217; of any of &#8217;em,&#8221;
observed Texas, slyly. But the Parson didn&#8217;t hear that.</p>

<p>He continued all innocent and unsuspecting as ever.
And when the Seven went to sleep at last it was with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
solemn promise on their lips to be up and doing in time
to reach the &#8220;cave&#8221; by midnight.</p>

<p>As for the Parson, he did not sleep at all; he was too
excited. The Parson was in a regular Captain Kidd humor
that night. Gold! Gold! He waited impatiently
until the &#8220;tac&#8221; had inspected after taps, and then he
turned over on his back and stared at the roof of the
tent and lay thinking over the extraordinary adventure he
had met with, and the still more extraordinary adventures
that were likely to result from it. He was even going
so far as to speculate what he was going to do with his
wealth. He&#8217;d divide it among the rest, of course. And
what magnificent fossils he was going to purchase with
his share!</p>

<p>He had not long to dwell over that, however. It was
two good miles through the woods to that cave, and it
might take them some time to find it besides. And not to
be there at twelve would be a calamity indeed. The
Parson hadn&#8217;t a very clear idea why he must dig at midnight
particularly, but he thought it best to obey orders
and ask no questions. So very soon after he heard the
sentry call the hour of half-past ten he sprang up and
awakened his fellow treasure hunters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>Indian was on guard that night; and so the six remaining
who were to conduct the expedition, found no
trouble in stealing out of camp. They arose and dressed
hastily, and then, not without some little nervousness
lest their absence should be noticed, they stole across their
friend&#8217;s sentry beat and made a dash for the woods.</p>

<p>Parson Stanard&#8217;s gold-hunting expedition was started.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED RESULT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The walk through that mountain forest was one to be
remembered for some time. In the first place, the Parson
had been provident enough to fee a drum orderly to steal
him a spade and hide it. The Parson insisted upon carrying
that spade himself, for that was what the old man
had said. And the Parson was careful to carry it upon his
shoulder, too. It was surprising how superstitious he had
suddenly become; during the dismal trip he enlivened
them by a classic discussion of the scientific evidence for
and against ghosts, goblins, and magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, gentlemen,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;one such experience
as this of mine convinces a man more than ten
thousand arguments, yea, by Zeus!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Texas went into a roar of laughter, which fortunately
wound up in a coughing fit and so excited no
suspicions.</p>

<p>Did you ever try to walk through a black woods at
night&mdash;a really dark night? Rocks and logs seem just
built to catch your shins; bushes and cobwebs for your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
eyes. And every one in the party vows that the way they
ought to go is off there. The six wandered about desperately,
time fairly flying and the excited guide and treasure
hunter getting more and more fearful lest the hour
should have passed.</p>

<p>It seemed almost by a miracle that they finally reached
the cliff in which lay the cave. The entrance was a bush-covered
hole in the rocks some ten feet from the ground.
The Parson lost not a moment in clambering up and
getting in, for he was in a hurry.</p>

<p>The five others, still chuckling joyfully over the success
of their deception, followed him in one after another.
The party had plenty of matches and candles provided this
time, and so one of the lamps in the uncanny place was
soon lighted, and then they were ready for work.</p>

<p>The Parson, businesslike and solemn, hauled out his
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three minutes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed the watch to Mark without another word.
Mark held it in his hand to give the signal and the Parson
whipped off his coat and seized the shovel with a desperate
grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to cut the carpet,&#8221; said one of them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>The Parson had thought of that; he hauled a huge
clasp knife from under his jacket. Mark considered it
a shame to spoil the place that way, and for a moment
he thought of telling and stopping the fun. But by that
time the thoroughly excited geologist was down on his
knees carving out a slice.</p>

<p>He had lit the lamp, according to the directions. Its
shadow, of course, fell right underneath, and there the
Parson was about to work.</p>

<p>There was a strange scene at that moment, if any one
had been there to see it. First there was the mysterious
dimly-lit cave; underneath the solitary light stood the excited
figure of the long-haired Boston genius, his eyes
glittering, his hand trembling. He clutched the spade
with determination, and gazed anxiously at Mark, like a
racer awaiting the signal. The five others were standing
about him, winking at each other slyly, and egging the
Parson merrily on. Oh, how they did mean to make him
dig!</p>

<p>It was a solemn moment for the Parson. To say nothing
of the treasure he meant to find there was his scientific
interest in the experiment, testing the old &#8220;wizard&#8217;s&#8221;
learning. Then suddenly Mark Mallory looked up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>&#8220;Now!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And the Parson jammed his spade into the ground the
same instant. The great treasure hunt had begun.</p>

<p>Fairly bubbling over with fun, the conspirators gathered
about him, stooping down and staring anxiously,
jumping about and exclaiming excitedly, and above all
urging the workman to still greater haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig! Dig!&#8221; they cried.</p>

<p>And you can rest assured the Parson did dig! His
long bony arms were flying like a machine. Beads of
perspiration gathered on his classic brow; his breath
came in gasps that choked off his numerous learned exclamations.
And yet he kept on, flinging the dirt in showers
about the room until the place began to look as if a
sandstorm had struck it. The Parson was working as
never had a parson worked before.</p>

<p>The others gave him little chance to rest, either; they
kept up his frenzy of excitement by every means they
could think of. But such working as that was bound to
end soon, for even geological muscles can&#8217;t stand everything.
In this case the end came of its own accord, for
the simple reason that the hole got too deep. In his wild
excitement Stanard had dug only a narrow one; and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
and by he got down so far that he could barely reach the
bottom with the end of his shovel. Then he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Zeus!&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;Gentlemen, this is&mdash;outrageous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shame!&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;What are we going to do?
Hurry up, it&#8217;s away after midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson gazed around him wildly; he was as anxious
to hurry as any one, but he didn&#8217;t know what to
hurry at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; growled Texas. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you fellers hurry
up thar? Whar&#8217;s that air treasure? Did you bring me
&#8216;way out hyar to git nothin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>This and dozens of similar remarks got the Parson
very much discouraged and disgusted indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen!&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I cannot help it, I really
cannot! I swear to you by all the inhabitants of Tart&aelig;us
that if I knew what to do I should do it with all possible
celerity. But what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any treasure there,&#8221; growled
Texas. &#8220;It&#8217;s all a fake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say, too, b&#8217;gee!&#8221; cried Dewey. &#8220;I just
believe the Parson wanted to show us he knew how to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
dig graves. I wish I were asleep in my tent! Reminds
me of a story I once heard, b&#8217;gee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell us any stories,&#8221; exclaimed Mark with
feigned anger. &#8220;The Parson has told us enough for one
night. This is outrageous.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor Parson had sunk into a chair in exhaustion
and resignation. Evidently there was no more fun to be
gotten out of him, Mark thought, and was about to
propose returning to camp, when suddenly another idea
flashed across him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jove!&#8221; he exclaimed, excitedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson sprang up again with a sudden renewal of
interest and life.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221; shouted Mark. &#8220;Ye gods! Why
didn&#8217;t I think of that before. I know why we haven&#8217;t
found the treasure!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson&#8217;s excitement was genuine; the others joined
in with his exclamations to keep up the effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; they cried, yet more loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did that wizard tell you to light the lamp?&#8221; Mark demanded
of the Parson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>&#8220;N&mdash;no,&#8221; stammered the other, obviously puzzled, &#8220;but
how else could it have a shadow?&#8221;</p>

<p>For an answer Mark sprang forward and extinguished
the lamp. Then he turned and cried triumphantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the partial darkness the light of the moon, coming in
through the hole, alone was visible. It struck the lamp
right full and cast a deep black shadow over in one corner
of the cave, close to the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; exclaimed Mark dramatically. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
spot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; cried Dewey, falling in with the scheme.
&#8220;So it is! And that&#8217;s why he told you to dig at midnight,
b&#8217;gee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the Parson had seized his spade and made a
regular kangaroo leap for the place. Before his hilarious
comrades could even start to follow he had broken ground
once more and was flinging the dirt about with even more
reckless eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go it, go it!&#8221; roared the rest.</p>

<p>The crowd gathered about him in a circle, clapping their
hands, dancing about, and shouting like &#8220;rooters&#8221; at a
baseball game in the oft-quoted case of &#8220;the ninth inning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
two out, score a tie,&#8221; etc. And never did a batter &#8220;lam
her out&#8221; with more vigor than the treasure-hunting
scholar &#8220;lammed her&#8221; into that ground.</p>

<p>They reached the two-foot mark, and then began the
same trouble of inability to reach the bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better make it bigger, b&#8217;gee,&#8221; laughed Dewey. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
give up. If it don&#8217;t work this time, b&#8217;gee, we&#8217;ll light every
other lamp in the place and try their shadows. And
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then with an exclamation of excitement the Parson
sprang back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve struck something!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; roared the crowd chuckling. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found
the treasure! Hooray!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard,&#8221; panted the excited Stanard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as hard as a rock, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Mark, with a sly
wink. And then he added under his breath, &#8220;A rock it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Parson was too busy to hear that. He was
working feverishly, plunging his spade into the ground,
flinging out the earth, occasionally hitting the object with
a sharp sound that made him get more overjoyed and the
rest get more convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>Truly the solemn Parson digging a trench was a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
ludicrous sight; his next move was more ludicrous still.
He got down on his stomach, flat, and reached into the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoop!&#8221; roared Texas, &#8220;it&#8217;s good he&#8217;s got long arms!
Hooray, we&#8217;ve got our treasure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by Zeus!&#8221; cried the Parson, springing up and
facing them. His next words almost took them off their
feet, and no wonder. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, solemnly,
&#8220;we have got a treasure! It&#8217;s got a handle!&#8221;</p>

<p>The five stared at each other in dumb amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;A handle!&#8221; they echoed. &#8220;A handle!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Mark flung himself to the ground, and
reached in.</p>

<p>When he got up again it was with a look on his face
that struck the others into a heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;as I live, it has got a handle!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson of course was not in the least surprised;
it was what he had been expecting all along. What surprised
him was their surprise, and incredulity, and blank
amazement. Each one of them must needs stoop and
verify Mark&#8217;s extraordinary statement, learn that there
was something down there with a handle for a fact. And
then, as completely subdued and serious as ever were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
merry jokers they took the spade from the exhausted
Stanard and set to work to dig with real earnestness, and
in silence. No exclamation they could think of came
anywhere near expressing their state of mind.</p>

<p>They widened the hole the Parson had made, and thus
exposed one corner of the object, which proved to be
a wooden chest, of what size they could not tell. And that
discovery completed the indescribable consternation of the
five. There never was a joke stopped much more abruptly
than that one.</p>

<p>They continued digging; to make a long story short
they dug for half an hour steadily, and by that time
had succeeded in disclosing the box which was over two
feet long and surrounded by hard clay. Having freed
it, Mark sprang down and tried to life it; he failed, and
they dug the hole yet wider still. Then, fairly burning
up with excitement and curiosity and eagerness, the whole
five got down into the ditch and lifted out the chest.</p>

<p>It cost them quite an effort even then; but they got it
out at last and gathered around it, staring curiously, whispering
anxiously. It was locked firmly, that they could
see. But the wood was rotten and Mark seized the shovel
and knocked the hinges off the back with one quick blow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Then the six stood and stared at each other, each one of
them hesitating for a moment before revealing that uncanny
mystery.</p>

<p>That did not last very long, however. Mark grasped
the lid firmly and wrenched it back. And as one man
the six leaped forward to glance in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry burst from throats of every one of them at
once. They sprang back and gazed at each other in
amazement. For that huge chest was fairly brimming
over with five-dollar gold pieces!</p>

<p>Oh, what a scene there was for the next ten minutes.
The cadets were fairly wild. They stooped and gazed
at the treasure greedily. They ran their fingers through
it incredulously; they danced about the cave in the wildest
jubilation. For there was in that chest money enough
to make each one of them rich.</p>

<p>And then suddenly an idea flashed over Mark. This
was a counterfeiter&#8217;s cave!</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it genuine?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Quick as a wink the Parson whipped two bottles from
under his coat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>&#8220;I thought of that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yea, by Zeus! One is
for gold, one silver.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wrenched the stopper out of one bottle and stopped
eagerly, the seven staring in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s gold,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;it&#8217;ll turn green!&#8221;</p>

<p>He snatched up one, and poured the acid over it. And
the six broke into a wild cheer as they saw the color
come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try another!&#8221; cried Mark.</p>

<p>For answer the Parson sprang forward and poured the
contents of the bottle over the coins. Everywhere it
touched the tarnished metal it showed the reaction. And
the six locked arms and did a war dance about the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re rich!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;We&#8217;re rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then they stole back to camp again.</p>

<small>DISCOVERY OF THE LOSS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This is where you wake up and find yourself rich;
how do you like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark, who asked the question, was yawning sleepily
as he sat up from his bed, a pile of blankets on the floor
of his tent. It was about five o&#8217;clock Sunday morning,
and the booming echo of the r&eacute;veille gun was still upon
the air. Down by the color line a drum was still rattling,
with a fife to keep it company. And throughout the
camp cadets were springing up to dress, just as were the
four we noticed.</p>

<p>There is no tent room in West Point for the man who
likes to lie in bed and doze for half an hour in the morning;
cadets have five minutes to dress in, and they have
to be out in the company street lined up for roll call at the
end of that time. And there is no danger of their failing
about it, either. They tell a good story up there about
one fond mother who introduced her young hopeful, a
soon-to-be plebe, to the commandant of cadets, and hoped
that they wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble getting &#8220;Montmorency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
dear&#8221; up in the morning; they never could get him up
at home.</p>

<p>But to return to the four A Company plebes who were
meanwhile flinging on their clothes and performing their
hasty toilets.</p>

<p>The lad who propounded the question was Mark, as
said before. The one who answered it was Jeremiah
Powers, and Texas vowed he liked being rich mighty well.
He got no chance to explain why or wherefore, however,
for by that time he was outside of the tent, and the resplendent
cadet officer was giving his stentorian order:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tenshun, company!&#8221;</p>

<p>At which signal the merry groups of cadets changed
into an immovable line of figures stiff as ramrods.</p>

<p>The plebes had come back to camp late last night, or
rather early this same morning, scarcely able to realize
what had happened. They were still striving to realize
it all as they sat whispering to each other in mess hall.
They were rich, all of them. How much they had none
of them had any idea. The learned Parson had informed
them&mdash;and he didn&#8217;t have to go to a book to find it out,
either, that a pound of gold is worth two hundred and
fifty dollars. Allowing two hundred pounds to that box,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
which was a modest guess indeed, left some seven thousand
dollars to each of them, a truly enormous fortune
for a boy, especially a West Point plebe who is supposed
to have no use for money at all.</p>

<p>Cadets do their purchasing on &#8220;check-book,&#8221; as it is
called, and their bills are deducted from their salaries.
And though they do smuggle in some contraband bills
occasionally they have no way of making use of large
sums. This was the problem the Banded Seven were discussing
through the meal and while they were busily
sprucing up their tents for &#8220;Sunday morning inspection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas was for quitting &#8220;the ole place&#8221; at a jump and
making for the plains where a fellow could have a little
fun when he wanted to. The fact that he had signed an
&#8220;engagement for service,&#8221; or any such trifle as that,
made no difference to him, and in fact there is little
doubt that he would have skipped that morning had it
not been for one fact&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t leave Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doggone his boots!&#8221; growled Texas, &#8220;ef he had any
nerve he&#8217;d come along! But ef he won&#8217;t, I s&#8217;pose I got
to let that air money lie idle.&#8221;</p>

<p>After which disconsolate observation Texas fell to polishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
the mirror that hung on his tent pole and said
nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of Texas running away!&#8221; laughed Mark.
&#8220;Think of him not having Corporal Jasper to come in on
Sunday mornings and lecture him for talking too much
instead of sprucing up his tent as a cadet should. Think
of his not having Captain Fisher to march him &#8217;round to
church after that and civilize him! Think of the yearlings
having nobody to lick &#8217;em any more! Think of Bull
Harris, our beloved enemy, who hates us worse than I
do warm cod liver oil, having nobody to fool him every
once in a while and get him wild!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark observed by that time from the twitching in his
excitable friend&#8217;s fingers and the light that danced in his
eye that his last hit had drawn blood. Texas was cured
in a moment of all desire to leave West Point. For was
not Bull Harris, &#8220;that ole coyote of a yearlin&#8217;,&#8221; a low,
cowardly rascal who had tried every contemptible trick
upon Mark that his ingenuity could invent, and who
hadn&#8217;t had half his malignity and envy knocked out of
him yet? And Texas go away? Not much!</p>

<p>Parson Stanard was heard from next. The Parson
knew of a most extraordinary collection of fossils from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the Subcarboniferous period. The Parson had been saving
up for a year to buy those fossils, and now he meant
to do it. He swore it by Zeus, and by Apollo, and by
each one of the &#8220;Olympians&#8221; in turn. Also the Parson
meant to do something handsome by that wonderful
Cyathophylloid coral found by him in a sandstone of Tertiary
origin. The Parson thought it would be a good
idea to get up a little pamphlet on that most marvelous
specimen, a pamphlet treating very learnedly upon the
&#8220;distribution of the Cyathophylloid according to previous
geological investigations and the probable revolutionary
and monumental effects of the new modifications thereof.&#8221;
The Parson had an idea he&#8217;d have a high old time writing
that treatise.</p>

<p>Further discourse as to the probable uses of the treasure
was cut short by the entrance of the inspecting officer,
who scattered slaughter and trembling from his eye. Methusalem
Z. Chilvers, &#8220;the farmer,&#8221; alias Sleepy, the
fourth occupant of the tent, was responsible for disorder
that week and the way he caught it was heartrending.
He was so disgusted that as usual he vowed he was
going to take his money back to Kansas and raise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
&#8220;craps.&#8221; After which the drum sounded and they all
marched down to chapel.</p>

<p>A delightful feeling of independence comes with knowing
you are rich. Perhaps you have never tried it, but the
Seven were trying it just then. They beamed down contentedly
on irate cadet corporals and unfriendly yearlings
with an air of conscious superiority that seemed to say,
&#8220;If you only knew.&#8221; Of the Seven there were only two
who were at all used to the sensation of being wealthy.
Texas&#8217; &#8220;dad,&#8221; &#8220;the Honorable Scrap Powers, o&#8217; Hurricane
County,&#8221; owned a few hundred thousand head of cattle,
and Chauncey, &#8220;the dude,&#8221; was a millionaire from New
York; but all the others were quite poor. Mark was calculating
just then what a satisfaction he meant to have in
sending some of that money to his widowed mother, to
whom it would be a very welcome present indeed.</p>

<p>He was thinking of that in the course of the afternoon,
when church and likewise dinner had passed, leaving the
plebes at leisure. And so he proposed to them that they
take a walk to pass the time and incidentally bring some
of that buried wealth back with them. Nothing could
have suited the Seven better, as it happened. They were
all anxiety again to get up to that cave and hear those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
gold coins jingle once more. To cut the story short,
they went.</p>

<p>It was a merry party that set out through the woods
that afternoon. The Seven were usually merry, as we
know, but they had extra causes just then. Everything
was going about as well for them as things in the world
could be expected to go. And besides this, Parson
Stanard, who was a wellspring of fun at all times, was
in one of his most solemn and therefore laughable moods
at present.</p>

<p>The thought had occurred to the Parson, as his first
sordid flush of delight at having wealth had passed, that
after all he was in a very unscholarly condition indeed.
The very idea of a man of learning being rich! Why it
was preposterous; where was all the starving in garrets
of genius and the pinching poverty that was always the
fate of the true patrons of Minerva. That worried the
Parson more than you can imagine; he felt himself a
traitor to his chosen profession. And with much solemn
abjurgation and considerable classical circumlocution he
called the Seven&#8217;s attention to that deplorable state of
affairs. Search the records of history as he could, the
Parson could not find a parallel for his own unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
condition. And he wound up the afternoon&#8217;s discussion
by wishing, yea, by Zeus, that he could be poor and happy
once more.</p>

<p>Dewey suggested very solemnly that nobody was going
to compel the unfortunate Parson to claim his share,
&#8220;b&#8217;gee&#8221;; that he (Dewey) would be pleased to take it if he
were only paid enough to make it worth while. But
somehow or other the Parson didn&#8217;t fall into that plan very
readily; perhaps he didn&#8217;t think Dewey really meant it.</p>

<p>Still chatting merrily, the Seven made their way through
the mile or two of woods that lay between the post and
the cave.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the opening the plebes were
startled to notice that the ground at the foot of the rock
was marked and torn with footprints.</p>

<p>The Seven had not done that, they knew, for they had
been of all things most careful to leave not the least trace
that should lead any one to suspect the presence of their
secret cavern. And consequently when they saw the
state of the ground there was but one thought, a horrible
thought that flashed over every one of them. Somebody
had been in their cave! And during the night!</p>

<p>Almost as one man, the Seven made a dash for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
entrance, scrambling up the rocks. There was never a
thought of danger in the mind of any one of them, never
a thought that perhaps some accomplice of the dead counterfeiters
had come to get the gold, might now be inside,
armed against the intruders. They had time to think of
but one thing. Somebody had seen them go in last
night, had seen them find the treasure! And now&mdash;and
now?</p>

<p>Texas was the first of them to get to the entrance, for
Mark was still lame with his injured arm. He flung his
body through the hole, half falling to the floor on the
other side. The rest heard him stumbling about and they
halted, silent, every one of them, scarcely breathing for
anxiety and suspense. They heard Texas strike a match.
They heard him run across the floor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And a moment later came a cry that struck them almost
dumb with horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, the money&#8217;s all gone!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<small>DISCOVERY OF THE THIEF.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The state of mind of the Seven cannot be described.
A moment before they had been upon a pinnacle of success
and happiness. And now it seemed that they had climbed
but that their fall might be all the more unbearable. All
their ambitions and plans, all the fun they meant to have&mdash;it
was too terrible to be true!</p>

<p>It was half with a feeling of incredulity that one after
another they climbed up to the opening and went in. Not
one of them could quite bring himself to believe that the
whole thing was not a horrible delusion, a nightmare.
But when they got inside they found that it was too true.</p>

<p>There was the deep trench that Parson Stanard had
dug; there was the spade he had dug it with, the tracks
of the others who had gathered anxiously about to watch
him. There was even one of the bright glittering gold
pieces half hidden in the dirt, a horrible mockery, as it
appeared to them; for the big wooden chest that had been
full to the brim with gold pieces, was gone, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
money with it. And all the hopes of the Banded Seven
were gone, too.</p>

<p>At first they stood and stared, gasping; and then they
gazed about the place in horror, thinking that surely they
they must find the chest lying somewhere else. But it
was not there. They dashed around the room, hunting in
every corner of the place, even in the locked cell, where
the ghastly skeletons lay grinning at them as if in delight.
But there was not a sign of the chest, nor of any one who
could have taken it.</p>

<p>And then suddenly Mark noticed a footprint in the soft
earth just underneath the entrance that told him the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve taken it out!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Feverish with disappointment and impatience, the
Seven scrambled out again through the hole. There on
the ground was the same footprint, larger than any of
theirs. It did not take half an eye to see that. There, too,
was a great three-cornered dent in the ground, showing
where the chest had been dropped. And there were finger
marks of the hand that had scooped up the fallen coins
to put them back into the chest.</p>

<p>Texas, plainsman and cowboy, had often told stories
of how he had followed a half-washed out trail for miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
across an otherwise trackless prairie. He was on his
knees now studying every mark and sign, his eyes fairly
starting from his head with excitement. And suddenly
he sprang to his feet as he noticed a trail a short way
off, a deep, smooth rut worn in the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;A wheelbarrow!&#8221; roared he.</p>

<p>A wheelbarrow it was, for a fact. And the track of it
lay through the woods to the river. Texas had started
on a run, without saying another word, and the rest
were at his heels.</p>

<p>The men who had taken that heavy chest down that
steep forest slope to the river must have had hard work.
Any one could see that as he looked at the mark of the
wheel. It would run down a slippery rock and plunge
deep into the soft earth at the bottom. It would run into a
fallen log, or plunge through a heavy thicket. And once,
plain as day was written a story of how the chest had
fallen off and the heap of scattered coins all been gathered
up again.</p>

<p>These things the plebes barely noticed in their haste.
They ran almost all the way. It was perhaps two hundred
yards to the river, and there was a steep, shelving bank,
at the bottom of which was a little pebbly beach. Down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the bank the wheelbarrow had evidently been run, half
falling, upsetting the box once more, and necessitating
the same labor of gathering up the coins. One of them
had been left in the sand.</p>

<p>The poor plebes realized then how hopeless was their
search. Deep in the sand was the mark of a boat&#8217;s keel,
and they knew that the work of trailing was at an end.
Their treasure was gone forever, stolen during the few
hours since they had left it last.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use shedding any tears about it,&#8221; said
Mark at last, when the state of affairs had had time to
be realized. &#8220;We&#8217;ve simply got it to bear. Somebody
probably saw us leave the camp last night and followed
us up here. And when they saw that treasure they just
helped themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is little that will make most people madder than
to be told &#8220;never mind&#8221; when they feel they have something
to be very much worried over. The Seven did mind
a great deal. They sat and stared at each other with looks
of disgust. Even the Parson (who ought to have been
happy) wore a funereal look, and the only one who had
a natural expression was Indian, the fat boy from Indianapolis.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
That was because Indian looked horrified and
lugubrious always.</p>

<p>They wandered disconsolately about the spot where the
boat had landed for perhaps five minutes, gazing longingly
at the trace of the boat in the sand and wishing they
could see it in the water as well, before any new development
came. But the development was a startling one
when it came. It took no detective to read the secret; it
was written plain as day to all eyes in an object that lay
on the ground.</p>

<p>Mark was the first to notice it. He saw a gleam of
metal in the sand, and he thought it was one of the coins.
But a moment later he saw that it was not, and he sprang
forward, trembling with eagerness and sudden hope.</p>

<p>A moment later he held up before his startled companions
a handsome gold watch. They sprang forward to
look at it. Crying out in surprise as they did so, and a
moment later he turned it quickly over. Written upon
the back were three letters in the shape of a monogram&mdash;a
monogram they had seen before on clothing, worn by a
yearling, and that yearling was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bull Harris!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>The scene that followed then precludes description.
The Seven danced about on the sand, fairly howled for
what was joy at one moment, anger at another. There
was joy that they had found a clew, that they knew where
to hunt for their treasure; and anger at that latest of the
many contemptible tricks that yearling had tried.</p>

<p>What Bull Harris had done scarcely needs to be mentioned
here&mdash;at least, not to old readers of this series.
He had tried every scheme that his revengeful cunning
could suggest to even matters with that hated Mark
Mallory. He had tried a dozen plans to get Mark expelled,
a dozen to get him brutally hazed. And they had
all been cowardly tricks in which the yearling took good
care to run no danger. This was the last, the climax;
he had stolen their treasure by night, and what was
almost as bad had he found their secret cavern. And as
Mark stood and stared at that watch he clutched in his
hand he registered a vow that Bull Harris should be paid
for his acts in a way that he would not forget if he lived
a thousand years.</p>

<p>And then he turned to the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t gain anything
by standing here. Let&#8217;s go back and watch Bull Harris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
like so many cats until we find out what he&#8217;s done with our
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Seven turned and made their way through the
woods once more, talking over the situation and their own
course as they went. They had room for but one idea in
their heads just now. They must find out where that
money was and get it back, if it was the last thing they
ever did in their lives.</p>

<p>It was clear that the hiding place could not be very
far away, and that Bull and his cronies must go to it
again. The Seven had left the place at about one in the
morning, and r&eacute;veille came at five; that gave but four
hours in which Bull, who it was presumed, had watched
them digging, had returned to West Point, gotten a boat
and wheelbarrow and taken the treasure away. He could
not have taken it a great distance in that time.</p>

<p>Another question was, who had helped him? Probably
some of his gang, Mark thought, until he chanced to
remember that Bull had another ally just then. He had
a cousin, a youth even less lovely than he staying at the
hotel. And then came another vague idea&mdash;perhaps he
had the treasure there. Bull could surely not have it in
his tent, and perhaps he had been afraid to bury it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>That was but a faint hope, yet Mark decided in a
moment to follow it up. He thought of a scheme. Grace
Fuller was at the hotel, and also George, the Fuller&#8217;s family
butler. George was a merry, red-faced Irishman, who
had once fired off some cannon at night for the plebes
and scared West Point out of its boots. Mark determined
after a moment&#8217;s consultation that George was the man to
investigate this clew for them.</p>

<p>As I said, it was only a possibility, a very bare one.
Mark strolled around near the hotel late in the afternoon
when he returned, keeping a sharp lookout for the man
just mentioned. When he saw him he whispered to him
and strolled slowly away.</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; said Mark, hurriedly, when the other joined
him, &#8220;do you know which is Cadet Harris&#8217; cousin, the
young man who&#8217;s staying in the hotel there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the butler. &#8220;His name&#8217;s Mr. Chandler.
Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a secret,&#8221; said Mark, briefly. &#8220;It&#8217;s something
important, and I want you to help me, without saying a
word to any one. Get one of the women, his chamber-maid
if you can, to find out if he&#8217;s got a box in his room.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the butler chuckled to himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>&#8220;Bless you, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I can tell you that now.
It&#8217;s the talk of the place, among the help. One of the
girls saw Mr. Harris and his cousin carrying a heavy box
up to his room just before r&eacute;veille this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Mark turned away again he was ready to shout
aloud for joy.</p>

<small>STEALING FROM THIEVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mark, when he rejoined his companions,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got pretty definite information to go on with now.
Mr. Chandler&#8217;s got our money in his room. The question
is what are we to do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>The plebes were sitting over in a secluded corner of
Trophy Point discussing this. Texas doubled up his
fists with an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git it back!&#8221; growled he, with a characteristic disregard
of details.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;Of course we could have him
arrested, for he knew the money was ours. But if we did
he&#8217;d tell how we skipped camp to dig it and we&#8217;d be
dismissed from West Point. Then there&#8217;d be the old
Nick to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One case where I&#8217;d be thankful I&#8217;m not in the habit
of paying my debts,&#8221; observed Dewey, tacking on a stray
&#8220;b&#8217;gee&#8221; as usual. &#8220;As to Bull and his cousin, I say we
punch their faces till they give up the money. Punch their
faces, b&#8217;gee!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>&#8220;Doggone their boots!&#8221; growled Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;That might hurt their boots,&#8221; laughed Mark, &#8220;but it
wouldn&#8217;t do us any good. I haven&#8217;t heard any feasible
suggestion yet. You know possession is nine points, and
they&#8217;ve got that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Mark who finally hit upon a plan that seemed
possible. It was a wild and woolly plan, too, and it took
Texas with a rush.</p>

<p>&#8220;They stole it from us,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what
better we can do than steal it back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; gasped Dewey&mdash;&#8220;b&#8217;gee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; laughed Mark. &#8220;And I mean this very
night, too. I mean that we turn burglars and get our
money out of there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mr. Jeremiah Powers let out a whoop just then
that made the windows rattle over in that selfsame hotel.
Jeremiah Powers hadn&#8217;t been quite so excited since the
time he rode out and tried to hold up the cadet battalion.
When the others assented to the plan and vowed their
aid, he nearly had a fit.</p>

<p>After that the Seven did almost nothing but glance at
their watches during the fast-waning Sunday afternoon.
There was no parade to pass the time. It seemed an age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
between the sunset gun and supper; and as for tattoo, all
the Parson&#8217;s much-vaunted geologic periods, times, ages
and eras, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Treassic,
Jurassic and Cretaceous, were not to be compared with
it in length. When they did finally get into bed they
waited another age for taps to sound, and another for the
tac to inspect, and another till the sentry called half-past
ten, and another for eleven, and another for half-past that,
and then twelve, and they couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer.</p>

<p>No matter if it was a rather early hour for burglars
to begin operations, they could not wait any longer. Not
a man of them had gone to sleep (except Indian), such
was their impatience. They got up, all of them, and began
to dress hastily, putting on some old clothes a drum orderly
had smuggled in. And a few minutes later that
momentous expedition crossed the sentry post unseen and
sat down in old Fort Clinton.</p>

<p>Nobody means to say for a moment that there was
one of them who was not badly scared just then. None of
them was used to playing burglar and they could not but
see that it was a very serious and dangerous business at
best. Old hands at it often get into serious scrapes, so
what shall we say of greenhorns? The only one of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
who had ever &#8220;done a job&#8221; was Texas, who had once
gotten Mark out of a bad scrape that way.</p>

<p>They discussed the programme they were to follow.
They knew where the room was and that it could be
reached by climbing the piazza pillars to the roof above.
Texas had climbed those pillars once before, and he had
a rope to help Mark and the rest up this time. After that
they were to enter that room, and Texas, the desperate
cowboy, was to hold young Chandler up till the deed
was done. That was all, very simple. But, oh, how they
shivered!</p>

<p>They were ugly enough looking fellows externally.
The clothes they wore were old and tough-looking, turned
up at the collars. Mark had in his free hand a dark
lantern, and Texas was clutching in his pocket a heavy
forty-four caliber which he meant to use. They had
masks, every one of them, or such masks as they could
make out of their handkerchiefs. And anybody who saw
them stealing across the grass to the hotel grounds would
have been very much alarmed indeed.</p>

<p>Fortunately it was a cloudy night, black as pitch.</p>

<p>Even the white trousers of the lonely sentries who
paced the walks about the camp were scarcely distinguishable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
The hotel was a black, indistinct mass looming
up in front of them. The chances of recognition under
such circumstances were few, the plebes realized with
a sense of relief.</p>

<p>Once hiding close under the shadow of the building
they wasted but little time in consultation. It was a creepy
sort of business altogether, but then they had started,
and so there was nothing to do but go right ahead. Most
of them had recovered from their first nervousness at
this crisis anyway, of course excepting poor Indian, who
had seated himself flat on the ground in a state of collapse.
Dewey was behind him ready to grab him by the mouth
in case one of Indian&#8217;s now famous howls of terror
should show any signs of breaking loose.</p>

<p>Texas and Mark meanwhile were proceeding calmly to
business. The pillars were very wide and high, and
Mark foresaw trouble in getting himself up them with his
crippled arm. And there was still more trouble in the
case of the gentleman from Indianapolis, whose fat little
legs wouldn&#8217;t reach halfway around. The difficulty was
fortunately removed by the finding of a short ladder in
back of the house. A very few minutes later the seven
anxious plebes were lying upon the piazza roof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>They wormed their way up close to the wall of the
building where they were safe from observation. And
while Mark devoted himself to keeping Indian quiet Texas
set out to reconnoiter. Poor Indian didn&#8217;t want to come,
and worse yet, he didn&#8217;t want to stay. He felt safer in
the hotel as a burglar than all alone outside in the darkness,
and he had an idea that even Camp McPherson
wasn&#8217;t safe without Mark. &#8220;Alas, poor Indian!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile as to Texas. Did you ever walk on a tin
roof? If you have you can imagine what a soul-stirring,
ear-splitting operation it is, at midnight, especially when
you are in burglar&#8217;s costume, with a revolver in one
hand and a dark lantern in the other. Every single individual
bit of tin on the flooring seemed to have a new
and original kind of sound to make, and the six watchers
quailed at every one of them.</p>

<p>Texas was hunting for the window that led into the hall
of the building. The room they meant to enter was unfortunately
on the other side. They had to force the
window, creep down the hall and get into that room. If
they could simply have entered it from a window, they
might have gotten out of this foolish scrape a good deal
more simply than they did.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>Texas managed to locate the window without much
trouble, and fortunately he found it open. He beckoned
the others silently, and they crept one by one down to
the place, Indian making twice as much noise as any one
because he weighed more. At any rate they climbed
through the window and into the lonely hall of the hotel,
where they stood and listened anxiously. They had not
been very quiet, but they did not believe they had awakened
any one; and after this they could be quieter.</p>

<p>They would have been very much scared and terrified
plebes, more so, all of them, than was Master Smith now,
if they could have known the true state of affairs. For
they had awakened some one. And though they had not
the least suspicion of it, a pair of sharp eyes had been
watching their every move.</p>

<p>They were very beautiful eyes, too. They belonged to
a young girl, a girl with lovely features and bright golden
hair. She was sleeping in one of the rooms on the second
floor that fronted on the piazza, and the sound that
awakened her had been the gentle tap upon the roof
when the ladder had been raised. She sat up in bed,
and a moment later arose and crept tremblingly to the
window. Peering out into the darkness she saw the top<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of the ladder, and a moment later saw a masked face appear
above it, and a masked figure climb up and creep
into the shadow of the building. Another followed it instantly,
and another; and then without a sound the girl
dodged down and stole across the floor of the room.</p>

<p>She crept silently to a trunk that was in one corner;
she raised the lid and fumbled about anxiously in the
darkness for something. It felt cold, like polished steel,
when she found what she wanted. She picked it up and
slipped a wrapper over her shoulders, then softly opened
the door of her room to peer out into the hall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as to the Seven whom we left standing inside
of the window down near the other end. They were,
as has been said, entirely unconscious of what has just
been mentioned. Texas had crept forward and extinguished
the light that burned in the hall, and they were
now standing in total darkness but for the single ray of
the lantern. They held a whispered conversation as to
what they should do next.</p>

<p>Parson Stanard volunteered to pick the lock of Chandler&#8217;s
door; he wasn&#8217;t a burglar by profession, by Zeus, said
he, but he believed in a gentleman of culture knowing
something about all the arts and professions. (This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
whispered in all seriousness.) And so the Parson crept
up to the door, the lantern in his hand. He knelt down
before the lock and fell to examining it cautiously, finally
thrusting in a bent piece of wire and getting to work. He
said he could get that door open in two minutes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others were huddled together waiting
anxiously. Indian was leaning against the wall, making it
shake with his nervous trembling, and Texas was peering
out of the window to make sure that there was no
sign of danger there. And then suddenly came the
thunderclap.</p>

<p>Nothing could be imagined more terrifying to the amateur
burglars than what actually happened in the next
half minute. There came first the sound of a creaking
door, a sound that made them start back. And an instant
later a figure sprang out into the hallway, a figure that
they could plainly see in the darkness, for it was white as
snow. The figure raised one arm and called in a voice
that was clear and unfaltering:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The plebes stood aghast, trembling. They knew the
voice, and that but increased their horror. For it was
Grace Fuller, their dearest friend!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>They all recognized her but one, and that was Texas;
Texas had been leaning out of the window and the voice
was not so distinct to him. He wheeled about with the
swiftness of a panther, giving vent to a cry of anger as
he did so. He flung his hand around to his pocket and
whipped out his revolver. Before the others could make a
move to stop him he swung it up to his shoulder.</p>

<p>And an instant later there came a blinding flash of light
and a loud report that awoke the echoes of the silent
building.</p>

<small>SEVEN BURGLARS IN A SCRAPE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The scene that followed beggars description. Mark had
leaped forward to seize the Texan&#8217;s hand, shouting aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! stop! It&#8217;s Grace Fuller!&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas started back in surprise; at the same moment
came the shot, which was from the girl&#8217;s revolver. It
was accidental, as she afterward declared, though the
plebes did not know it then. The result frightened Grace
even more than it did them, the bullet buried itself in the
wall, but the sound of the report was followed by a wail
of agony from the terrified Indian, which echoed down
the hall. And Grace heard shouts from various parts of
the hotel, doors opening, people running about, and she
knew that her friends were in deadly peril.</p>

<p>A much more hopeless situation it would be hard to
imagine; the girl was horrified. But her first thought
was had she wounded Indian, and she dashed wildly down
the hallway to them.</p>

<p>One glance at the huddled group of figures sufficed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
answer that question. Before she could make another
sound there came a bounding step upon the stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be discovered!&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the window; but a single glance outside
showed him two figures running across the lawn. There
was no hope of escape there. They were gone!</p>

<p>An instant later Grace Fuller&#8217;s clear tones rang in his
ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a flash she turned and dashed down the hallway
to her room. Mark followed at her heels, and the rest
of them, too, dragging the half-paralyzed and terrified
Indian along, while the shouts and footsteps swelled louder
and louder to urge them on.</p>

<p>They were just in time. Grace Fuller had scarcely
time to push the last one in and then slam the door before
three men, one of them her father, dashed around a turn
of the hall and confronted her white figure standing at the
door, the revolver still in her hand.</p>

<p>The huddled plebes inside were too alarmed to think.
They heard the quick-witted girl call to the men:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! Hurry up. This way!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then they heard the footsteps die away again, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the men with her at their head dashed down the hall
toward the rear stairs of the building. They knew that
for the time they were safe.</p>

<p>They stood panting and breathless, listening for a moment.
They heard the noise at the rear increase; it was
evident that everybody was hurrying in that direction.
Mark sprang to the window and looked out. He saw
three men running toward the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where they went up!&#8221; he heard one of them
say.</p>

<p>And then came a shout from the rear and the three
dashed around the building in that direction, leaving the
lawn clear and the place deserted. Mark turned and cried
to the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Quick! Now&#8217;s our chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a desperate chance, but they took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;One dash for the camp,&#8221; whispered Texas. &#8220;Git in
an&#8217; hide, no matter what!&#8221;</p>

<p>They leaped out of the window and made a dash for
the ladder. A second or two might make all the difference
now. They might get a start, or again they
might find a man with a revolver to stop them at the foot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
It was a critical situation, and the plebes were quick as
lightning, even Indian.</p>

<p>Texas dropped to the ground, and Dewey after him.
They could not wait for the others to get down the ladder.
Mark slid down like a flash, holding to the side with one
hand. Indian slipped halfway and tumbled the rest.
Chauncey, Sleepy and the Parson came down one on
each side, almost on top of them, and a second or two
later the Seven were at the foot staring about them like
so many hunted animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried Mark, seeing no one. &#8220;For your
lives!&#8221;</p>

<p>They sprang forward and dashed away toward the
camp. They had not gone a dozen yards before there
came a shout from the rear of the hotel, a shout that
swelled to a roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go! Quick! Stop &#8217;em! Halt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Halt? Not much! Those plebes were running as
never did man run before. Even Indian was breaking
records, fear urging him to prodigies of speed. Fortunately
there was no one of the pursuers who was armed,
but they were in hot pursuit, and their shouts might have
the camp awake any moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>It was a very short distance to the camp, but to the
burglars it seemed a league. They expected a pistol shot
any moment, and yet they could not run any faster.
They bounded across the path, through the bushes and
on, until suddenly a high embankment loomed up before
them. It was Fort Clinton, and they dashed around the
corner and into the camp beyond.</p>

<p>They were not so quick but that the foremost of those
in chase saw clearly where they went; and the cry swelled
out upon the breeze:</p>

<p>&#8220;The camp! The camp! The burglars are hiding in
the camp! Don&#8217;t let them get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately the sentry of the post had been at the other
end of the path. There was no danger of his recognizing
them, but he saw them cross his beat and vanish among
the white tents. He heard the cry of &#8220;Burglars!&#8221; and as
he came dashing down the path toward the spot his shouts
ran out above the others:</p>

<p>&#8220;Corporal of the guard! Post number three!&#8221;</p>

<p>Camp McPherson was in an uproar ten seconds after
that. The shouting awoke every cadet in the place and
brought them all to their tent doors at a bound. The
young corporal dashed out of the guard tent and around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
to the sentry&#8217;s aid, the tactical officer in command right at
his heels with a clank of sword. At the same moment
up rushed the crowd of excited half-clad men from the
hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burglars! Burglars! They&#8217;re hiding in the camp!&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant (the tac) took in the situation in an instant.
He dashed down the path, warning the sentries as
he ran. The officer at the guard tent turned out the members
of the guard a moment later and hurried them away
to double the watch about the camp. At the same time
the &#8220;long roll&#8221; was being sounded by a drum orderly up
by the color line, summoning the cadets to form at once
on the company street.</p>

<p>Truly those burglars were to have a hard time getting
out of that trap, into which they had gotten so easily.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what as to the Banded Seven? The time
between when they entered camp and rushed into their
two tents and when the company battalion formed was
perhaps one minute. In that brief space the plebes had
flung off their clothes and hid them feverishly under their
blankets, then leaped into their uniforms and fallen into
line. And that was the end of their danger.</p>

<p>The battalion once formed there was a hasty roll call,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
showing all present. And then began a search of the
place. The officers, and some of the men from the hotel
searched every tent, every spot within the camp. And
when they found no burglars they gathered together and
stared at each other and wondered how that could be.
The tacs interviewed the sentries, and each swore that
no burglars or any one else had run across their beats.
After which came another search, and another failure, and
more mystery.</p>

<p>That those burglars had been cadets on a lark no one
dreamed. For they had been desperate-looking burglars,
masked and armed. But where were they now?</p>

<p>No one knew, and no one knows to this day. The cadets
returned to their tents, discussing the curious situation,
and in a few minutes more the camp had settled into its
customary stillness.</p>

<small>WATCHING THE TREASURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Any news yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I guess they&#8217;re waiting till night to move
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose they knew the burglars were after it
last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. They haven&#8217;t the least idea of it, I&#8217;m
sure. I heard Bull Harris talking about it this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Seven were waiting for a summons to drill, and
sitting in one of the tents of the summer encampment.
The cadet who was answering the questions was Mark.
He had just entered the tent as the conversation before
mentioned began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bull Harris will never get that treasure away from
us,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That is, not unless he has more
sense than I think he has. Bull is busy all day, nearly
the same as we; so I think he&#8217;ll try to move it at night.
We can watch him then, and stand a fair show to get it
back. You see it was only night before last that he stole
it from our cave, and I think he&#8217;s pretty sure we haven&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
found it out yet. We&#8217;ve been careful not to awaken any
suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keerful!&#8221; echoed Texas. &#8220;Pshaw! I don&#8217;t see whar
the keerful part is. We stole over thar to the hotel last
night an&#8217; went up to the room and tried to run off with it.
An&#8217; ef somebody hadn&#8217;t a seen us, we&#8217;d a had it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bull Harris has small idea that those desperate burglars
were his old plebe enemies,&#8221; laughed Mark. &#8220;I
heard him talking about the burglars to the cadets this
morning. He said he thought they had come up from
Highland Falls and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was cut short just then by the rattle
of a drum, which caused the plebes to spring up and hustle
out of the tent in a hurry to &#8220;fall in&#8221; for the morning
drill in evolutions, which ended the plotting, for that hour
at least.</p>

<p>The treasure was still in the hotel. By way of penance
for her last night&#8217;s stupidity, Grace Fuller had volunteered
to see that the chest was not carried from the place that
day without the plebes learning of it. Mark had been over
to inquire a short while ago; his report had been as
stated.</p>

<p>He was mistaken, however, in his idea that the yearling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
had no idea who the burglars were. Young Chandler
had picked up a revolver dropped in the hall by Texas.
Texas hadn&#8217;t missed it; he had too many for that. But
this one had his initials on it, and Chandler had &#8220;caught
on&#8221; to the state of affairs in no time. So Bull did know
that he was watched, and he was using all his cunning to
outwit his unsuspecting enemies. A chest of gold was a
stake worth playing hard for.</p>

<p>Slowly the day passed. Chandler still held on to that
revolver, with the &#8220;J. P.&#8221; on the hilt. Likewise to the box
of treasure in the corner of his room. And he and Bull
were busily plotting a way to remove it to safety, and if
possible get its real owners into trouble besides. Bull
thought they might make another effort to steal it. &#8220;It
would be just like the fools,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and if they do,
they won&#8217;t get away quite so easily again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull had a decided advantage in the matter, as you may
easily see. He was working with his eyes open. He knew
the situation. The Seven, on the other hand, were blinded
by their supposition that they were unwatched and unsuspected.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bull had what Texas would have called the
&#8220;drop&#8221; on them with that gun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>He was going to cap the climax by getting the treasure
safely out of reach; then he calculated that his long-sought
revenge over Mark would be obtained.</p>

<p>Bull watched Mark and his &#8220;gang&#8221; slyly during the
day. Bull hated each and every individual member of that
gang with all the concentrated hatred of which he was
capable. Mark had foiled and outwitted him at every
turn&mdash;the wild and woolly Texan had thrashed him once;
&#8220;Indian,&#8221; the fat and timid &#8220;kid&#8221; from Indianapolis, had
gotten mad one day and interrupted one of Bull&#8217;s hazing
bees, attacking the yearling with a fury that had knocked
him off his feet.</p>

<p>Then there was the Parson, who was one of the most
inoffensive scholars this world has ever made, but he did
object to being tied in a sack &#8220;like a member of the
Turkish harem,&#8221; as he vividly described it. And when
Bull tried that, the Parson had a fit and put his classical
and geological muscles at work on Bull&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p>Then came &#8220;B&#8217;gee&#8221; Dewey, light-hearted, with a laugh
that put everybody in a good humor. Not so Bull; Dewey
had once had the nerve to refuse to climb a tree because
Bull said to, and had given Bull two black eyes during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the scrimmage that followed. Besides these there were
&#8220;Chauncey, the dude,&#8221; and &#8220;Sleepy, the farmer,&#8221; who
had once attacked Bull and five other yearlings, and who,
besides this, had dared to join Mallory&#8217;s gang, an unpardonable
offense anyhow. Bull Harris had much to
revenge, but he thought he was about to make up for all
of it in a very brief time.</p>

<p>The day passed without incident to interest us. It was
the usual routine of duty for the plebes, with much drilling
and very little rest. Grace Fuller kept some one
watching Chandler all day with no result; and that is all
there is to be said.</p>

<p>The plot began to unfold itself that night, however.
Chandler strolled in to see Bull after supper, a fact which
the Seven noticed with no small amount of glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fixing up something for to-night,&#8221; they whispered.</p>

<p>That seemed to be the state of affairs for a fact, and the
Seven made a compact then and there to stay awake and
prevent it if it was the last thing they ever did in their
lives.</p>

<p>That is, all of them but one. The one was the Parson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
The Parson, it appeared, had been &#8220;geologizing&#8221; during
the morning; he had secured some extraordinary specimens
of rocks. There were pyrites and fluorites, belemnites
and ammonites, hematites, andalusies and goniatites,
to say nothing of Hittites and Jebusites, added by the facetious
Dewey, with outasites and gottabites. However
that may be, Parson Stanard had found a piece of &#8220;horn-blend,
with traces of potassium nitrate manifested.&#8221; So
extraordinary a phenomenon as that could not be allowed
to pass unnoticed, especially for any quantity of ordinary
twenty-two carat gold, with no interest to the chemist
whatsoever. The Parson vowed he was going to analyze
that specimen that evening as soon as camp was quiet.</p>

<p>Dewey suggested that evening ought to be pretty good
time to test for &#8220;nitrates,&#8221; whereupon the Parson turned
away with a solemn look of pain and fell to examining his
chemicals. The Parson had discovered a loose board in
the flooring of his tent, and with true Bostonian originality
he had hidden all his specimens and apparatus under
that; the Texan&#8217;s revolvers were there, too, making a
most interesting collection of articles altogether.</p>

<p>We must go on to the adventures of the evening. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Parson&#8217;s chemistry was destined to play a most important
part in the affair, but not just at present.</p>

<p>Tattoo sounded, calling the cadets to roll call and bed;
taps comes half an hour later, &#8220;lights out and all quiet.&#8221;
Then the &#8220;tac&#8221; inspected and went to bed also, after which
the Parson got up, let down his tent walls, lighted his candle,
and set out his array of test-tubes and reagents. Then
also Texas got up and stole out of the tent, past the sentry,
and over to the hotel.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that the place was to be watched
from the distance every moment that night. Texas had
put in a claim to be first, and he was on his way to spend
an hour hiding in the bushes. Chandler and Bull Harris
weren&#8217;t going to remove that treasure without a &#8220;scrap.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it happened, Texas was not going to have to wait
long. It appears that Bull imagined that the Seven were
going to try burglary again; his plan to fool them was to
hide the treasure early, before the people in the hotel were
quiet, and so before the plebes could do anything. Then,
the treasure once out of the way, Chandler might easily
trap the plebes. It was quite a clever scheme indeed, and
Bull was in a hurry to put it into execution.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>He stole out of camp as Texas had done, and stole into
the hotel at the rear entrance. At the same moment Texas
rose up out of the bushes and sped away toward camp at
the top of his speed.</p>

<p>Which was where the excitement began.</p>

<small>THE SEVEN IN A TRAP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Some ten minutes after Bull Harris vanished in the
shadow of the hotel, two figures came down the stairs,
bearing a heavy burden between them. There was no one
in the neighborhood to observe them. They crept out the
back door and gently deposited their load upon a wheelbarrow
that stood near. A moment more and they and
the wheelbarrow, too, had disappeared in the shadow of
the trees.</p>

<p>At the same instant six figures dashed past the sentry at
the camp and set out to follow swiftly. They were the
members of the Banded Seven, minus the chemical Parson.
The other two were Chandler and his cousin.</p>

<p>The latter were wary as foxes; they were aware of the
fact that they might be followed, and Bull was glancing
over his shoulder at every step. But owing to the sentries
that patrol the post, he had to keep in the dark
shadow of the woods by the river front, and that was
where the six got their chance to hide. They were cautious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
too; even our fat friend, Joseph Smith, was as
silent and stealthy as any genuine &#8220;Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull and his companion skirted the buildings to the
south, and emerged upon the road to Highland Falls.
Down this they hurried for a short distance, and then
turned into a patch of thick woods just above cadet limits.
In the center of the woods they halted, set down their load
and went right to work without further parley. They
were going to bury the treasure, where it would be safe
beyond possibility of danger.</p>

<p>That was their plan. To be very brief, I may say that
they did not get far. Bull had barely had time to plunge
his spade into the ground before there came a sound of a
snapping twig that made him start as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>It was a dark night, very dark, and the two frightened
rascals could distinguish little. But one thing they did
see; that was the grinning countenance of the &#8220;son o&#8217; the
Hon. Scrap Powers, o&#8217; Hurricane County, Texas,&#8221; at
the present moment peering over the barrel of a luminous
and voluminous revolver.</p>

<p>There never was a hold up more sudden and complete
than that, at least not in the experience of our cowboy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
friend. Chandler had a revolver in his pocket (the one
that Texas had dropped), but he did not dare to make
a move to touch it. He was too well aware of Jeremiah
Powers&#8217; reputation among the cadets. Chandler and Bull
could do nothing but stare and gasp.</p>

<p>It was not part of the programme of the six to keep
them in suspense for any time. Texas kept his gun leveled,
reinforced by another in his other hand, while Mark
and his companions, smiling cheerfully, stepped out and
proceeded to take possession in genuine Dick Turpin
style.</p>

<p>In the first place, there were the prisoners to be attended
to. They were too much confounded and frightened
to resist, and they speedily found themselves lying
flat as pancakes on the ground, tied hand and foot, with
handkerchiefs in their mouths for an extra precaution.
Then, and then only, Texas shoved his revolvers back
where they came from; and the others laid hold of the
wheelbarrow and the whole crowd strolled merrily away,
whistling meanwhile.</p>

<p>For which please score one for the Banded Seven.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their triumph was destined to be a very
transitory one. I blush to record it of my most cautious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and wary friend from Texas, but it is true, and truth must
be told. Texas actually forgot to search his man when
he held him up! The result was that the revolver, a terrible
bit of evidence, was still in Chandler&#8217;s pocket. But
that was not all. So sure were the six plebes of their complete
triumph, that they even failed to tie their prisoners
apart.</p>

<p>The last of the party had scarcely turned away before
Bull, glancing about him with his cunning, catlike eyes,
rolled swiftly over until he was at his cousin&#8217;s side. He
bit at the rope that tied the latter&#8217;s hands; he could not
have chewed more savagely if he had hold of Mallory&#8217;s
flesh. Chandler&#8217;s hands were free in a moment, and it was
the work of but a few moments more to whip out his knife
and loosen Bull. The sound of the plebes&#8217; merry laughter
had not died away in the woods before the two were on
the trail, creeping stealthily up behind their unsuspecting
victims with their load of gold. And Chandler had the
revolver in his hand now by way of a precaution.</p>

<p>Not so very far back in the woods on the way to Highland
Falls stood an old and dilapidated icehouse. Some
may remember that icehouse; it figured rather prominently
in one of Mark&#8217;s adventures. Mark had not been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
in West Point a week before his cheerful friend Bull had
tried to lock him up in that place so as to have him absent
from r&eacute;veille. Bull had failed, fortunately, and Mark
had turned the tables on him. Bull had had unpleasant
recollections of that icehouse ever since.</p>

<p>It was toward that building the six happy and triumphant
plebes were heading; Mark had chanced to
think of it, and of the fact that its soft sawdust would
make a most excellent hiding place for the wonderful
treasure. The plebes could hardly realize that they had
that treasure safe. After all the vicissitudes it had been
through, all the disappointments and anxiety it had caused
them, it seemed to be too good to be true. And they ran
their fingers through the chinking contents of the old
chest; it was too dark to see it, but they could feel it, and
that was enough to make them chuckle for joy.</p>

<p>They were in a particularly jolly humor as they hurried
through the woods. Dewey was as lively as a kitten,
and was being reminded of jokes enough to take up
the rest of this story; and he kept it up until the building
they were looking for loomed up in front of them.</p>

<p>The plebes lost no time about the matter; they opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the creaky door and the whole six of them hurried in to
superintend the all-important burial ceremony.</p>

<p>Their figures had scarcely been lost in the darkness
before the other two stole out of the woods and halted at
the edge of the clearing. The two were stooping low,
creeping with the stealth of catamounts. So silent were
they there was not even the snap of a twig to betray them,
and when they stopped they scarcely dared breathe as they
listened. One of the crouching figures clutched a revolver
in his hand; the other&#8217;s fists were clinched until the nails
dug into his flesh. His teeth were set, and his eye
gleamed with a hatred and resentment that he alone knew
how to feel. Bull Harris felt that his time had come, the
time he had waited for, for two long months of concentrated
yearning.</p>

<p>There were sounds of muffled laughter from inside, and
the thud of the spade that some one was using. Bull
glanced at his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>And the other nodded, though his hand shook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221; hissed Bull. &#8220;It is a risk, for that
fiend of a Texan may fight. You may have to shoot. Do
you hear me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>Once more Chandler nodded, and gripped the revolver
like a vise.</p>

<p>There was not another word said. The two crouched
low and stepped out of the shadow of the bushes. Silently
as the shadows themselves they sped across the open space.
And then suddenly Bull halted again; for the sound of
murmuring voices from inside the little building grew
audible as they advanced.</p>

<p>&#8220;B&#8217;gee, it&#8217;s a regular Captain Kidd business! I don&#8217;t
think Bull was a success as a Kidd, that is, if you spell it
with two d&#8217;s. He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Mark,&#8221; interrupted another voice, &#8220;do you remember
the time that ole coyote tried to lock you in hyar?
Doggone his boots, I bet he don&#8217;t try that very soon
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; laughed Mark, softly. &#8220;Bull had his
chance once, but he failed to make the most of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And at the words Bull seized his cousin convulsively by
the arm and forced him back. Before the other could see
what the yearling meant he had sprung forward, gasping
with rage. The next instant the heavy door creaked and
swung too.</p>

<p>Mark and his allies started back in alarm. Before they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
could make another move, before they could even think,
they heard the rusty lock grate, heard a heavy log jammed
against the door to hold it tight.</p>

<p>And then a low, mocking laugh of triumph rang on
their ears. Bull Harris&#8217; time had come at last.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />


<small>BUYING THEIR RELEASE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Our business just now is with Parson Stanard, the
scholarly geologist and chemist, sitting all by himself in
his silent tent and diligently analyzing his hematites and
gottabites and outasights. The Parson made a curious
figure; you would have laughed if you could have seen
him. A solitary candle gave the flickering light by which
he worked.</p>

<p>The Parson was a trifle agitated about that candle, because,
as you know, it is the correct thing for a scholar
to burn &#8220;midnight oil.&#8221; The midnight part was all right,
but it took a long stretch of the imagination to convert
tallow into kerosene. That kind of chemistry was too
much for even the Parson.</p>

<p>However, it had to be borne. The Parson was seated
in tailor fashion, in spite of which posture he was managing
as usual to display his sea-green socks to the light.
He had a row of bottles in a semicircle about him, like so
many soldiers on parade; and at that moment he was engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
in examining a most interesting and complicated filtrate.</p>

<p>Parson Stanard was at the climax of his important
night&#8217;s work. It will be remembered he was testing for
potassium nitrate. He had it. He had put some of the
substance in the fire and gotten the violet flame he wanted.
Then, to make sure, he reached forward and took one of
the bottles.</p>

<p>But the Parson never made that test. If the Banded
Seven had seen him at that moment they would assuredly
have been frightened, for his face underwent a most
startling and amazing transformation. He had picked up
the bottle; glanced at its label. And the next instant his
eyes seemed fairly to pop up out of his head. His jaw
dropped, his hands relaxed, and the wondrous and long-sought
powder was scattered over the floor.</p>

<p>The Parson was ordinarily a quick thinker, but it took
a time for that thought, whatever it was, with all its horrible
import, to flash across his mind. And meanwhile
his face was a picture of consternation.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he leaped to his feet with a perfect gasp
of horror, knocking the candle over and making the bottles
rattle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>&#8220;By the thunderbolts of Jove!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;By the
hounds of Diana! By the distaff of Minerva!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson was striding up and down his tent by this
time, utterly regardless of chemistry, geology, and possible
discovery in the bargain.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the steeds of Apollo!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;By the
waters of the Styx, by the scepter of Zeus, by the cap of
Mercury, by the apple of Venus and the bow of Ulyssus!
By the nine immortals and the Seven Hills of Rome!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings the agitated chemist
was out in the company street, and striding away in the
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the eagle of Ganymede, by the shield of Mars, by
the temple of Janus, by the trident of Neptune!&#8221;</p>

<p>During this the gentleman was speeding out of camp,
causing the sentry, who thought he was crazy, so much
alarm that he forgot to challenge. By the time he recovered
the Parson was gone and only an echo of his voice
remained&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the forge of Vulcan, by the cave of &AElig;olus, by the
flames of Vesta!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not to continue the catalogue, which it would be found
contained all the mythology from Greek and Sanskrit to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Hindoostanee, suffice it to say that the agitated scholar
strode straight down the road to Highland Falls with all
the speed that a scholar could assume without loss of dignity
and breath. Also that he turned off the road at the
precise place his comrades had and vanished in the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;They said they were going to bury it in the icehouse,&#8221;
muttered the Parson. &#8220;It is there I shall endeavor to intercept
them and inform them of this most extraordinary
conditions of affairs. Yea, by the all-wise, high-thundering
Olympian Zeus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more excited the Parson got the more Homeric
epithets it was his custom to heap upon the helpless head
of his favorite divinity; he was very much excited just
now.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the Parson did not know just where the
icehouse was; he had never been to it but once, and he
wandered about the woods hunting in vain for at least
half an hour. Then he sat down in despair and gasped for
breath, and listened. And in that way he was suddenly
made aware of the whereabouts of the object of his search.</p>

<p>A sound came to his ears, a loud laugh in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho! You fools! Dig a tunnel, hey? Ho, ha!
Well, suppose you dig it. I&#8217;ve a revolver here, and I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
blow the blamed head off the first man that comes out.
How do you like that. Guess again, Mark Mallory.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson sprang up as if he had sat down on the
proverbial haystack with a needle in it. That voice was
the voice of the &#8220;enemy,&#8221; Bull Harris! A moment later
the Parson was creeping toward the sound with stealthiness
that would have done credit to an Apache.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in the hands of the enemy,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;By
the all-wise, high-thundering, far-ruling Olympian Zeus!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; roared the voice, nearer now. &#8220;Think you
can break the door down, hey? Well! well! Guess I&#8217;ll
have to put a new log against it. How do you like that!
That&#8217;s right! Whack away! Bully! Keep it up and you
may get out by to-morrow night. Ho! ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>The unfortunate Zeus got a few more epithets then,
and the Parson crept nearer still. In fact, he got so near
that peering out of the bushes, he could spy the clearing
with the little building and the two figures dancing gayly
in front of it. Bull Harris was fairly convulsed with joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got my revenge!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it! I told
you I&#8217;d get it! Didn&#8217;t I tell you so? I told you I&#8217;d have
you B. J. plebes out of here if I died for it. And now my
time&#8217;s come! Hooray! You&#8217;ll be found to-morrow, beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
cadet limits, and out you go. You can&#8217;t deny it!
How do you like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go to Halifax! you ole coyote,&#8221; growled a
smothered voice from the inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me! Ho, ho! What do I care? I&#8217;ve nothing to lose.
I&#8217;m ready to go. But you&mdash;ho, ho! Ask that fool Mallory
how he likes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; responded a cheery voice. &#8220;You must remember
that we&#8217;ve got the treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good it&#8217;ll do you,&#8221; chuckled Bull. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be in
State&#8217;s prison in a week or so. Ho, ho! Let&#8217;s tell &#8217;em,
Chandler. The secret&#8217;s too good a one to keep. Ask
Texas what became of the revolver he dropped in the hotel
last night playing burglar. The revolver with the initials
J. P. on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a thunderbolt. From the way it struck the horrified
prisoners dumb. Bull knew it, and laughed with
yet more malignant glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t prove it!&#8221; roared Texas furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I?&#8221; chuckled Bull. &#8220;You&#8217;d hate to have me try.
It would take all your gold to get you out of that scrape,
I fancy. Ho, ho! Court-martial! State&#8217;s prison! I
guess I&#8217;ve got the best of it for once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time,&#8221; growled Texas.</p>

<p>During all this the Parson had been hiding in the
bushes, trembling, gasping, slowly taking in the situation,
the dilemma his friends were in. All thoughts of the excitement
under which he had originally set out were gone.
He was cudgeling his head to see what he was to do to
turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p>It was a difficult problem, for Chandler had a revolver
and the Parson had none. This was evidently a case
where cunning and not brute force were to tell, and the
Parson knitted his learned brows thoughtfully. Meanwhile
the conversation was going on, and taking a new
turn. Bull Harris had a proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you fellows are ready to acknowledge you&#8217;re
beaten,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;And I suppose you&#8217;ve got sense
enough to see what a fix you&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the whole Seven saw it clearly, but
they were not ready to acknowledge it to Bull.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to say,&#8221; the latter continued, after a moment&#8217;s
pause, &#8220;that there&#8217;s a way for you fools to get out
of this. If you don&#8217;t choose to do it you may as well
make up your minds to stay all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; responded Mark, laughing at this introduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
to a very obvious offer. &#8220;I suppose you think
we&#8217;re going to let you get hold of our treasure. I suppose
you think we&#8217;ll purchase our freedom with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I do,&#8221; said Bull, &#8220;else you stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; laughed Mark, coolly. &#8220;And you can go
to blazes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proposition was not lost upon the Parson, lying in
the bushes outside. The Parson had drunk in every word
of it, and for some reason began to gasp and wriggle
with suppressed excitement as he realized the meaning of
the offer. As Mark spoke the last time the Parson slid
back into the woods and stole softly around to the rear of
the little building.</p>

<p>A few moments later, Mark, to his astonishment, heard
a faint whisper in one of the crevices at the back. &#8220;Say,
Mark!&#8221; That voice Mark would have known had he
heard it in China. He ran to the spot and there was a
minute&#8217;s quick conversation. At the end of it the Parson
turned and crept way again, unseen by the two in front.</p>

<p>Perhaps five minutes later Bull Harris, who was still
crowing merrily, was electrified to learn that the plebes
had reconsidered their first defiance&mdash;that the gold was
his!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to give it up,&#8221; said Mark, briefly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got us, and that&#8217;s all that there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; cried Bull, unable to hide his joy, &#8220;that
if we let you out and give you the revolver you are willing
to give up the treasure altogether?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;We are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how am I trust you?&#8221; demanded Bull. &#8220;If I open
the door how do I know you won&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said I wont!&#8221; interrupted Mark, with angry emphasis.
&#8220;You know me, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a funny thing. Bull himself would have lied all
day without his conscience troubling him. But somehow
or other he was sure that Mark wouldn&#8217;t. In spite of his
cousin&#8217;s protestations, he stepped forward, removed the
barricades and turned the key.</p>

<p>The six plebes came out, looking sheepish enough.
Texas received his lost revolver meekly, though he felt
like braining Bull with it. A minute later the six hurried
off into the woods, leaving Bull and his cousin to gloat
for hours over the chest of gold they left inside.</p>

<p>Truly, it was a triumph for Bull.</p>

<small>BULL HARRIS REAPS HIS REWARD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the evening of the following day, and the scene
was Highland Falls. It was about twelve o&#8217;clock at night,
to be more exact as to time; as to place, the scene was a
low tavern on the roadside.</p>

<p>This hour was long after the time that cadets are supposed
to be in their tents asleep, but as we have seen,
cadets do not always do as they are supposed to. It is
safe to say that in spite of all the talk about the severity
of West Point discipline, if the commandant of cadets
should take it into his head to wander through Camp
McPherson every night for a week running, he would
find some things to surprise him. He might not find any
geological chemists hard at work, but he might find a
small game of some sort going on on the sly, and he&#8217;d be
sure to find a surreptitious banquet or two. He might
also see occasional parties steal past an obliging sentry
who was looking the other way. It is probable, however,
that none of this would surprise him very much, for he
did it all himself in his day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>There are always bolder and more reckless spirits who
are ever ready for such a lark, enjoying it in proportion
to the risk they run. There are always some among these
who think it manly to drink and smoke, and frequent low
places; it is upon one of these latter assemblages that we
are about to look in. We must not mind a rather unpleasant
odor of bad tobacco, or a still more unpleasant
odor of bad liquor.</p>

<p>It is quite needless to say that one of the crowd was
Bull Harris; it would be hard to find a crowd of cadets
amusing themselves as these were without Bull among
them. This tavern was the regular resort of him and his
&#8220;gang&#8221; on occasions when they visited Highland Falls.
It has not been mentioned before, because the less said
about such places the better.</p>

<p>Bull liked this place for many reasons. It was quiet,
and there was nobody to disturb them. Then, too, the
proprietor, a fat Irishman, known as &#8220;Jake,&#8221; was a man
who told no secrets and minded his own business, thus
keeping an ideal place for a crowd of young &#8220;gentlemen&#8221;
to come for a lark. Bull was there to-night, and what
was more important, he was acting as host. Bull was
&#8220;blowing off&#8221; his friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>There was first, his Cousin Chandler, whom we know;
then there was Gus Murray, who needs but little introduction.
As an ally and worshiper of Bull and a malignant
enemy of Mark Mallory&#8217;s, Gus Murray yielded to no one,
with the possible exception of Merry Vance, the shallow
and sour-faced youth on his right. The cause of Merry&#8217;s
pessimistic complexion we once guessed to be indigestion;
inasmuch as he was just then pouring down his third
dose of bad brandy a revision of this surmise will be allowed.
To complete the party, there was one more, a
very small one, our young friend, Baby Edwards, a
sweet-tempered little sneak who had not even manliness
enough to be vicious.</p>

<p>When we peered in the party was in full swing. Baby
Edwards had half gone to sleep, having drunk two
glasses of beer. Bull had just completed for the third
time a graphic description of how that Mallory had been
duped, a story which was a never-failing source of interest
and hilarity to the rest, who were whacking their
glasses on the table and cheering merrily, in fact, so merrily
that the cautious proprietor was forced to come to the
door and protest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>&#8220;How much did you say it was worth?&#8221; demanded
Vance, after the man had gone away again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty thousand dollars,&#8221; chuckled Bull. &#8220;Fifty thousand
if a cent. Fill &#8217;em up, boys. Chandler and I calculated
it weighed two hundred pounds. Whoop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Merry&#8217;s eyes glistened feverishly as he listened,
whether from brandy or from what he heard it would be
hard to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whereabouts is it now?&#8221; demanded he. &#8220;Are you
sure Mallory can&#8217;t get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead sure,&#8221; laughed Bull. &#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d be
fool enough to let Mallory sneak up behind me twice.
Not much! It&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whereabouts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s buried up here in the woods a piece,&#8221; said the
other, cautiously. &#8220;It&#8217;s where we can get it any time we
want to. Oh, say, but it&#8217;s fine to know you&#8217;re rich&mdash;no
trouble about paying any confounded bills. And that
Irish villain Jake can&#8217;t kick because we drink more than
we can pay for. Whoop! Help yourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were helping themselves for all they were
worth. It seldom happened to that crowd to get a chance
such as this, and cadet duties might go to blazes in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
meantime. They were singing and shouting and fast getting
themselves into a very delightful state, indeed, keenly
enjoying themselves every minute of the time, so they
thought.</p>

<p>Fun like that can&#8217;t last very long, however. Baby Edwards
went to sleep as I said! it is to be hoped he dreamed
of better things. Merry Vance got quiet and stupid also,
while Gus Murray waxed cross and ugly. So pretty soon
Bull concluded it was time to go home. Anybody who
glanced at the bottles scattered about on the floor and
table would have thought so too.</p>

<p>At this stage of the game Jake bowed himself in. Jake
was usually a Nemesis, an undesired person altogether, for
he came to collect. But Bull didn&#8217;t mind this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wants me money,&#8221; began the man, surlily, gazing
about him at the scene of destruction. &#8220;An&#8217; what&#8217;s more,
I wants to say you fellows has got to make less noise here
nights. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have my license taken away for no
cadet. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull gazed at him sneeringly during this discourse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything more?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is. You fellers ain&#8217;t a-comin&#8217; here no more
till you pays yer bills. This is the third time you&#8217;ve tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to let &#8217;em run, an&#8217; by thunder I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to stand it. I
don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve got no money anyhow, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to stop this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up, confound ye!&#8221; broke in Bull, impatiently.
&#8220;Who asked you to trust them? Don&#8217;t be a
fool! Take that and shut up your mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>These not over polite remarks came as Bull flung three
or four of the five-dollar gold pieces with a lordly air onto
the table. The fellow eyed them greedily, then gathered
them up and left the room.</p>

<p>Bull turned to rouse his companions, chuckling to himself
as he did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Get up there and hustle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baby Edwards, having been kicked unceremoniously
to the floor, got up growling. Merry Vance likewise
wanted to fight Gus, who woke him. But the five got
started finally and made for the door. Beyond that, however,
they did not get, for there they encountered the
brawny form of Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said he, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want now?&#8221; demanded Bull.</p>

<p>The other extended his hand, in which lay the coins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want &#8217;em,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>Bull stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want &#8217;em!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;In the name of Heaven
why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No good,&#8221; said the other, sententiously.</p>

<p>The effect of those two words upon Bull was like that
of a bullet; he staggered back against the wall, gasping,
his eyes fairly starting out of his head. The others understood
dimly and turned pale.</p>

<p>It took several minutes for that idea to dawn upon Bull
Harris in all its frightful horror. When he realized it he
sprang forward with a shriek.</p>

<p>&#8220;No good!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Great Heavens, man, what do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The proprietor&#8217;s response was brief, but effective. He
put his hand in his pocket and brought out a shining
stone. He rubbed it against the gold and held it up so
that Bull might see the color that resulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t gold,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It&#8217;s counterfeit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull staggered back against the wall again. Counterfeit!
Counterfeit! He saw it all now! Saw why Mallory
had given it up! Saw what a fool he&mdash;Bull Harris&mdash;had
been! Saw that he had let them out of the trap, given
them the weapon, the only proof. Let them go in safety,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
leaving him a chest full of brass. It made Bull sick to
think of it. Oh, surely it could not be true!</p>

<p>Another thought flashed over him then. Why had
Mallory fought so for it, why been so reluctant to give it
up? No, it must be genuine! It must be a mistake!
Perhaps those few were bad, but all the coins could not
be. Trembling with dread, Bull sprang forward,
wrenched the stone from the hand of the astonished
&#8220;Jake,&#8221; burst out of the place, and sped away up the road.</p>

<p>The man was at his heels at this effort to dodge him
without paying. Behind him rushed the other four, frightened
and sobered by this terrible blow. But Bull&#8217;s anxiety
lent speed to him and he easily outdistanced the crowd.</p>

<p>When they came upon him again they found him in the
woods on his knees, digging savagely in the ground with
his fingers. In response to his shouts they flung themselves
down to help him, while the breathless Irishman
stood by and stared in amazement.</p>

<p>Bull was in a frenzy. He fairly tore his way down to
the chest, and seizing it by the handles, jerked it out with
the strength of a Hercules. He flung back the lid, jerked
the bit of rock from his pocket, and seized a handful of
the coins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>A moment more and he staggered back, and sank to the
ground, limp and helpless.</p>

<p>The chest of &#8220;gold&#8221; was worthless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We must revert to the conversation of the Seven the
night before, for the benefit of those who are curious.
Mark and his friends, as they disappeared in the woods,
were joined by the solemn Parson. You may believe that
it was a merry crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Parson,&#8221; demanded Mark, the first thing.
&#8220;Are you sure that money is no good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; echoed the Parson. &#8220;Sure as I am that the
most reliable and mathematical of all the sciences is true.
Perhaps you will wish, gentlemen, that I explain to you
the most extraordinary state of affairs. I shall do so,
yea, by Zeus. I feel that I owe it to myself by way of
explanation of a most unaccountable&mdash;ahem&mdash;blunder I
have made.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson drew a long breath and continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when first we set out upon that
treasure hunt I took with me two bottles of acid. One
was a test for the presence of argenic compounds, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
silver, and the other for what is popularly designated gold.
In the excitement of the discovery of the chest, to my
everlasting humiliation, be it said, I used the wrong acid.
The reaction I got proved the presence of copper. I
thought it was gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this extraordinary speech of self-abnegation the
Parson bowed his head in shame. It was at least a minute
before he could muster the courage to go on. Truly that
had been a frightful blunder for an analytical chemist to
make.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night,&#8221; he continued at last, &#8220;I was testing for potassium,
and I reached for that bottle of gold reagent. I
expected to find it half empty. I found it full, and I knew
in an instant that I could not have used a drop of it. Gentlemen,
that told me the story of my error. I shall do
penance for it as long as I may live.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE SEVEN MAKE A NEW MOVE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, man, what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cause of this exclamation was Dewey. At the moment
his uniform was dirty and torn, and his face was
far from handsome. It was bruised and blue in lumps,
and there were ugly places of a bright red, lending a
startling effect indeed.</p>

<p>The speaker was Mark. He had been sitting at his
tent door rubbing his gun diligently, but he sprang up in
alarm when he espied the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth has happened to you, Dewey?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>Dewey laughed to himself, in spite of his sorry condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;B&#8217;gee, I&#8217;ve forgotten
lots of things in the last ten minutes. I&#8217;ll come in and
think &#8217;em over and tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He entered the tent, and after gazing at himself ruefully
in the looking-glass that hung by the tent pole, wet
a towel and fell to washing things gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>&#8220;B&#8217;gee!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;Mark Mallory, there&#8217;s going
to be no end of trouble on account of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me yet,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean that you&#8217;ve been getting hazed some more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you call it hazing,&#8221; responded Dewey, &#8220;if you&#8217;d
been pummeled until you looked like rare beef? You
needn&#8217;t be getting angry about it. We&#8217;ll have plenty of
time for that later. Meantime, just you listen to my tale
of woe, b&#8217;gee! I was down on Flirtation Walk a while
ago, off in a lonely part. And all of a sudden I came
across half a dozen yearlings. One of them was Bull
Harris, and when he saw me he turned to the other cadets
and called: &#8216;There&#8217;s one of the gang now! We might
just as well start at what we agreed on.&#8217; And then, b&#8217;gee,
they started. Do you think that eye&#8217;ll shut up entirely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they do?&#8221; demanded Mark, his blood boiling
as he surveyed his comrade&#8217;s bruises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, b&#8217;gee, they sailed up, in the first place, and began
a lot of talking. &#8216;You belong to that Mallory gang, don&#8217;t
you?&#8217; said Bull Harris. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I do, and I&#8217;m proud
of it, too. What&#8217;s the matter with Mallory?&#8217; &#8216;Matter?&#8217;
roared Gus Murray. &#8216;B&#8217;gee, he&#8217;s the confoundedest freshest
plebe that ever came to this academy. Hasn&#8217;t he dared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to refuse to let us haze him? Hasn&#8217;t he played all kinds
of tricks upon us, made life miserable for us? Hasn&#8217;t he
even dared to go to the hop, something no plebe has ever
dared to do in the history of West Point?&#8217; &#8216;Seeing that
you&#8217;re asking the question, b&#8217;gee,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t mind
telling you by way of answer that he has, and also that he&#8217;s
outwitted you and licked you at every turn. And that
he&#8217;ll do it again the first chance he gets, and b&#8217;gee, I&#8217;ll be
there to help him, too! How&#8217;s that?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the reckless youngster paused while he removed
the cork of a vaseline bottle; then he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;That made old Bull wild; he hates you like fury,
Mark, and he&#8217;s simply wild about the way we fooled him
with that treasure. He began to rear around like a wild
man. &#8216;If you fool plebes think we&#8217;re going to stand your
impudence,&#8217; he yelled, &#8216;you&#8217;re mistaken! I want you to
understand that we&#8217;ve found out about that confounded
organization Mallory&#8217;s gotten up among the plebes to
fight us&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say that?&#8221; cried Mark, in surprise. &#8220;How did
they learn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dewey. &#8220;They don&#8217;t know we call
it the Banded Seven, or anything else about it, but they&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
seen us together so much when they&#8217;ve tried to haze us
that they&#8217;ve sort of guessed it. Anyway, they&#8217;ve determined
to break it up, b&#8217;gee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have! How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply by walloping every man in it, b&#8217;gee. And they
started on yours truly. The whole crowd piled on at once,
Mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cowards!&#8221; exclaimed Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I gave &#8217;em a good time, anyway,&#8221; laughed
Dewey, whose natural light-heartedness had not been
marred in the least. &#8220;I made for Bull. B&#8217;gee, I was
bound one of them would be sorry, and I chose him. I
lammed him two beauties and tumbled him into a ditch.
But by that time they had me down. And&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the rest of the Seven?&#8221; cried Mark, springing
up impatiently. &#8220;By George, I&#8217;m going to get square
for this outrage if it&#8217;s the last thing I ever do in my life.
I&#8217;ll fight them fair just as long as they want it. I&#8217;m ready
to meet any man they send, as I did. But, by jingo, I
won&#8217;t stand the tricks of that miserable coward Bull Harris
another day. He&#8217;s done nothing but try to get me into
scrapes since the day I came here, and refused to let him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
haze me. And now I&#8217;m going to stop it or bust. Where
are the rest of the fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; began Dewey, but he was interrupted
by an answer from an unexpected quarter. Texas came
rushing down the company street and bounded into Mark&#8217;s
tent.</p>

<p>He, too, was marred with the scars of battle. His clothing
was soiled, and his bronzed features were sadly awry.
And Texas was wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; he roared, his words fairly tripping each other
up, in such rapid succession did they come. &#8220;Whoop!
Say, you fellows, you dunno what you been a-missin&#8217;! I
ain&#8217;t had so much fun since the day I come hyar. Jes&#8217;
had the rousin&#8217;est ole scrap I ever see. There was a
dozen of &#8217;em, them ole yearlin&#8217;s, and they all piled on to
once. Whoop! Mark, git up thar an&#8217; come out an&#8217; help
me finish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas was prancing around the tent in excitement, his
fingers twitching furiously. He gasped for breath for a
moment, and then continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was that air ole Bull Harris and his gang. Bull
had been a-fightin&#8217; somebody else, cuz one eye was black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully, b&#8217;gee!&#8221; put in Dewey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>&#8220;An&#8217; he was mad&#8217;s a hornet. &#8216;Look a yere,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;you rarin&#8217; ole hyena of a cowboy, I want you to understand
that you an&#8217; that air scoundrel Mallory&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;an&#8217;,
Mark, I never gave him a chance for another word, jes&#8217;
piled right in. An&#8217; then all the rest of &#8217;em lit on to me
an&#8217; there was the wust mess I ever heerd tell of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angry though Mark was, he could not help being
amused at the hilarity of his bloodthirsty friend and fellow-warrior,
who was still dancing excitedly about the
tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who won?&#8221; inquired Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; said Texas. &#8220;I never had a chance to find
out. First they jumped on me and smothered me, an&#8217;
then I got out and jumped on them, only there was so
many I couldn&#8217;t sit on &#8217;em all to once, an&#8217; so I had to git
up ag&#8217;in. Oh, say, &#8217;twas great. I wish some o&#8217; the boys
could a&#8217; been thar to see that air rumpus. An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
through yit, either. I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to lambast them air yearlin&#8217;s&mdash;what
d&#8217;ye say, Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas gazed at his friend inquiringly; and Mark
gripped him by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to settle that crowd
for once and for all if I have to put them in hospital.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
And now let&#8217;s go out and hunt for the rest of the Seven
and see what&#8217;s happened to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s patience was about exhausted; he had stood
much from Bull Harris, but as he left that tent and strode
out of camp with the other two at his side, there was a
set look about his mouth and a gleam in his eyes that
meant business.</p>

<p>He had scarcely crossed the color line that marked the
western edge of the camp before he caught sight of one
more of the Seven. And Mark had seen him but an instant
before the thought flashed over him that this one had
been through just the same experience as Texas and
&#8220;B&#8217;gee&#8221; Dewey.</p>

<p>The new arrival was Parson Stanard. His face was
not scarred, but it was red with anger, and his collar was
wilted by excitement which betrayed itself even in his
hasty stride as he walked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, by Zeus!&#8221; he cried, as soon as he reached his
friends. &#8220;Gentlemen, I have tidings. The enemy is risen!
Even now he is hot upon our trail. My spirit burns within
me like that of Paul Revere, the messenger of liberty,
riding forth from good old Boston town. Boston, cradle
of liberty, father of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>The Parson&#8217;s news was exciting, but even then he could
not withstand the temptation to deliver a discourse upon
the merits of his native town. Mark had to set him
straight again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Bull been after you, too?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea!&#8221; said the Parson. &#8220;He has, and that, too, with
exceeding great vehemence. Truly the persistency of the
yearling is surprising; like the giant Antaeus of yore, he
springeth up afresh for the battle, when one thinks he is
subdued at last. Gentlemen, they attacked me absolutely
without provocation. I swear it by the undying flame of
Vesta. I was peregrinating peacefully when I met them.
And without even a word, forsooth, they sprang at me.
And mighty was the anger that blazed up in my breast,
yea, by Zeus! As Homer, bard immortal of the Hellenic
land, sang of the great Achilles, &#8216;his black heart&#8217;&mdash;er, let
me see. By Zeus, how does that line go? It is in the first
book, I know, and about the two hundred and seventy-fifth
line, but really I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind Homer,&#8221; laughed Mark. &#8220;What about
Harris? What did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I replied to their onslaughts in the words of Fitz<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
James: &#8216;This rock shall fly from its firm base as soon as
I!&#8217; The two who reached me first I did prostrate with
two concussions that have paralyzed my prehensile apparatus&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for the Parson!&#8221; roared Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; continued the other sheepishly, &#8220;observing,
by Zeus, that there were at least a dozen of them, I concluded
to think better of my resolution and effect a retreat,
remembering the saying that he who runs away may
live to renew his efforts upon some more auspicious occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Parson looked very humble indeed at this last confession;
Mark cheered him somewhat by saying it was the
most sensible thing he could have done. And Dewey still
further warmed his scholarly heart by a distinction that
would have done credit to even Lindley Murray, the
grammarian.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t break your resolution,&#8221; said Dewey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; inquired Stanard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, b&#8217;gee, you vowed you wouldn&#8217;t fly. And you
haven&#8217;t flown since, that I see. What you did was to flee,
b&#8217;gee. If you flyed you wouldn&#8217;t have fleed, but since you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
fleed you didn&#8217;t fly. Some day, b&#8217;gee, when you&#8217;ve been
bitten, you&#8217;ll understand the difference between a fly and
a flea. You&#8217;ll find that a flea can fly a great deal faster than
a fly can flee, b&#8217;gee, and that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody jumped on Dewey and smothered him again
just then, but it wasn&#8217;t a yearling. He bobbed up serenely
a minute later, to find that the Parson&#8217;s grammatical
old ribs had been tickled by the distinction so carefully
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;People are very grammatical in Boston, aren&#8217;t they,
Parson?&#8221; inquired Dewey. &#8220;Reminds me of a story I
once heard, b&#8217;gee&mdash;you fellows needn&#8217;t groan so, because
this is the first story I&#8217;ve told to-day. Fellow popped the
question to his best girl. She said, &#8216;No, b&#8217;gee.&#8217; &#8216;Say it
again,&#8217; says he. &#8216;No!&#8217; says she. &#8216;Thanks,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Two
negatives make an affirmative. You&#8217;ve promised. Where
shall we go for our honeymoon?&#8217; B&#8217;gee, Parson, there&#8217;s
a way for you to fool your best girl. She&#8217;s sure to say no,
and I don&#8217;t blame her either.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lively Dewey subsided for a moment after that.
But he couldn&#8217;t keep quiet very long, especially since no
one took up the conversation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>&#8220;Speaking of oranges,&#8221; said he, &#8220;reminds me of a story
I once heard, b&#8217;gee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was speaking of oranges?&#8221; cried Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; said Dewey solemnly, and then fled for his
life.</p>

<p>The other three members of the Banded Seven arrived
upon the scene just then and put an end to hostilities.
Chauncey, Sleepy and Indian had not had the luck to meet
with the yearlings yet, and they listened in amazement
and indignation while Mark told the story of Bull Harris
and his latest tactics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul,&#8221; gasped Indian in horror. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m going
home this very day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go home myself,&#8221; vowed Mark, &#8220;if I don&#8217;t succeed
in stopping this sort of business. I honestly think I&#8217;d
report it to the authorities, only Bull knows I&#8217;ve been out
of bounds and he&#8217;d tell. As it is, I&#8217;m going to settle him
some other way, and a way he&#8217;ll remember, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; cried the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;This very night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cave!&#8221; responded Mark; and it was evident from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
the way the others jumped at the word that the suggestion
took their fancy.</p>

<p>And in half a minute more the Seven had sworn by all
the solemn oaths the classic Parson could invent that they
would haze Bull Harris and his cronies in &#8220;the cave&#8221; that
night.</p>

<small>THE CAPTURE OF MARK.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The afternoon of that momentous day passed without
incident. Mark noticed Bull Harris glowering at him as
he passed his tent, but beyond that the &#8220;subduing&#8221; programme
got no further. The Banded Seven kept near to
camp, so as to prevent it.</p>

<p>That is, all of them but one; Sleepy was that one. The
lanky farmer was a member of the guard that day, getting
his first lessons in the terrible dangers of sentry duty
at Camp McPherson. Now it was necessary for some one
to go up and fix that cave for the night&#8217;s work, and since
Sleepy succeeded in getting excused during his four hours
off duty that afternoon, he was unanimously elected to be
the one to attend to the task.</p>

<p>It was to clear away the effects of that treasure hunt
that Sleepy went. He removed all traces of the Parson&#8217;s
energetic digging. Also he fixed quite a number of other
things, according to Mark&#8217;s well-planned directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s evident to me,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;from the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Bull didn&#8217;t bother me this morning, hating me most, as
he does, that he&#8217;s putting up a plan for to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s afraid to tackle you in the day,&#8221; growled Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; chirruped Indian&#8217;s fat, round voice.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you lick him once, and the whole crowd besides.
Bless my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; continued Mark, &#8220;that we may take it for
granted that Bull will try to kidnap me to-night. You
know they did that once, took me off into the woods and
beat me. They&#8217;ll beat harder this time. If a big crowd
of them tries it you fellows&#8217;ll just have to make a noise
and wake everybody so that they&#8217;ll have to drop me and
run for their tents. But if there&#8217;s only a few you can follow
and overpower them. It all depends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas rubbed his hands gleefully at this attractive programme.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we a-goin&#8217; to do when we ketch &#8217;em?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You leave that to me,&#8221; laughed Mark, rising from his
seat to end the &#8220;conference.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a scheme fixed
up to frighten them to death. Just wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait&#8221; seemed to represent about all there was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
do, though the Seven did not like it a bit. They watched
dress parade that evening with far less interest than
usual, and sighed with relief when the sunset gun finally
sounded. It may be interesting to note that there were
some other cadets in just exactly the same impatient state
of mind.</p>

<p>It was just as Mark had suspected&mdash;Bull Harris had a
plot.</p>

<p>The sunset gun was welcomed with relief. They spent
the evening strolling about the grounds and discussing
the effort they were going to make that night, also occasionally
chuckling over the &#8220;success&#8221; of their attacks during
the morning. And then tattoo sounded, and they
knew that the time was nearer still.</p>

<p>Bull Harris and his three cronies waited until the sentry
had called the hour of eleven. They thought the
plebes had had time enough to get to sleep then, so they
got up and dressed and sallied forth in the darkness. It
was cloudy that night, and black, a circumstance which
Bull considered particularly fortunate.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation, no delay to discuss what should
be done. The four made straight for a certain A company
tent; cadets sleep with their tent walls rolled up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
hot weather, and so the yearlings could easily see what
was inside. They made out three figures stretched out
upon the blankets, all sound asleep; the fourth occupant&mdash;the
farmer&mdash;was now diligently marching post.</p>

<p>The four crept up with stealthiness that would have
done credit to Indians. A great deal depended on their
not awakening Mallory. Bull, who was the biggest and
strongest of the crowd, stole into the tent and placed himself
at Mallory&#8217;s feet; Merry Vance and Murray calculated
each upon managing one stalwart arm, while to
Baby, as smallest, was intrusted the task of preventing
outcry from the victim. Having placed themselves, the
four precious rascals paused just one moment to gloat over
their hated and unsuspecting enemy. And then Bull gave
the signal, and as one man they pounced down.</p>

<p>Mallory, awakened out of a sound sleep, found himself
as helpless as if he had been buried alive. Bull&#8217;s sinewy
arms were wrapped about his limbs; his hands were
crushed to the earth; and Baby was smothering him in a
huge towel. They lifted him an instant later and bore
him swiftly from the tent.</p>

<p>A whistle was the signal to the sentry, who faced about
and let them cross his beat; the four clambered up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
embankment and sprang down into Fort Clinton, chuckling
to themselves for joy, having secured the hated plebe
with perfect success and secrecy. And now he was theirs,
theirs to do with as they saw fit. And how they did mean
to &#8220;soak&#8221; him!</p>

<p>All this, of course, was Bull&#8217;s view of the matter. But
there were some things, just a few, that that cunning
young gentleman did not know of. The reader will remember
that the yearlings had tried that trick on Mark
just once before; ever since then Mark&#8217;s tent was protected
by a very simple but effective burglar alarm. There
was a thread tied about his foot. That thread the yearlings
had not noticed. It broke when they carried off their
victim, but it broke because it had tightened about the
wrist of Texas, who sat up in alarm an instant later, just
in time to observe the four disappearing in the darkness.
By the time they had crossed the sentry beat the rest of
the Banded Seven were up and dressing gleefully.</p>

<p>After that the result was never in doubt for a moment.
The five all crossed the sentry&#8217;s post without trouble, because
they had heard the signal the yearlings gave. And
a moment later the triumphant kidnapers, who were off in
a lonely corner of the deserted fort binding up their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
prisoner as if he were a mummy, were horrified to find
themselves confronted by five stalwart plebes.</p>

<p>Bull and his gang were helpless. They did not dare
make any outcry, in the first place, because they were more
to blame than the plebes in case of discovery, and in the
second, because they were &#8220;scared to death&#8221; of that wild
cowboy, who had already made his name dreaded by riding
out and holding up the whole artillery squadron.
But, oh, how they did fairly grit their teeth in rage!</p>

<p>The imperturbable Texas stood and faced them, twirling
two revolvers carelessly while they had the unspeakable
humiliation of watching the others ungaging and unbinding
the delighted Mallory, who rose to his feet a moment
later, stretched his arms and then merrily took command.</p>

<p>Bull Harris was selected, as leader and head conspirator,
to undergo the first torture. Mark placed himself in
front of him, and with a light smile upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Bull found himself staring into the muzzle of one of
the menacing Texan&#8217;s revolvers. That took all of Bull&#8217;s
nerve, and he very promptly &#8220;lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, Dewey,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;tie him up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>Dewey used the very ropes that had been meant for
Mark. He tied Master Harris&#8217; unresisting feet together.
Then rolled him unceremoniously over on his back and
tied his hands. After which Bull was kicked to one side,
and Dewey was ready for the next frightened yet furious
victim.</p>

<p>Pretty soon there were four helpless bodies lying side
by side within the fort. They were bound hand and foot;
there were gags tied in their mouths and heavy towels
wrapped about their eyes. And then the Banded Seven
were ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ahead,&#8221; said Mark.</p>

<p>He set the example by tossing Bull&#8217;s body upon his
shoulders and setting out. The rest followed close behind
him.</p>

<p>It was quite a job carrying the four bodies where our
friends wanted to take them, especially without being
seen by any one.</p>

<p>They made for the Hudson. In Mark&#8217;s day cadets
were allowed to hire rowboats, that is, all except plebes.
But it was easy enough for a plebe to get one, as indeed
to get anything else, tobacco or eatables. The small drum
orderly is always bribable, and that accounts for the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
that two big rowboats lay tied in a quiet place, ready for
the expedition.</p>

<p>Since the den was near the shore oars furnished an
easier way to carry the prisoners to the place.</p>

<p>They found the boats without trouble, and deposited
the yearlings in the bottom. They weren&#8217;t very gentle
about it, either. Then the rest scrambled in, and a long
row began, during which those who were not working at
the oars made it pleasant for the unfortunate yearlings by
muttering sundry prophecies about tortures to come, and
in general the disadvantages of being wicked. The Parson
recited some dozen texts from Scripture to prove that
obvious fact.</p>

<p>We shall not here stop to picture the infuriated Bull
Harris&#8217; state of mind under this mild torture. Enough of
that later. Suffice it to say the row came to an end an
hour or so later, and the party stepped ashore. And also
that before, they started into the woods a brilliant idea occurred
to the ingeniously cruel Texas. They meant to
make those cadets shiver and shake; what was the matter
with letting them start now, where there was plenty of
nice cold water handy?</p>

<p>A whispered consultation was held by the six; it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
agreed that in view of all the brutality of Bull and his
gang, there was no call to temper justice with mercy. As
a result of that decision each one of the yearlings was held
tight by the heels, and, spluttering and gasping, dipped
well under water and then hauled up again. That did not
cool their anger, but it made them shiver, you may well
believe. During this baptismal ceremony the classic Parson
was interesting, as usual. He sat on a rock nearby
and told the story, embellished with many allusions, how
the &#8220;silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the
sea,&#8221; as Homer calls her, took her son, &#8220;the swift-footed&#8221;
Achilles, and dipped him into a magic fountain to give
him immortality. All got wet but the heel she held him
by, and so it was a blow in the heel that killed the Grecian
hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore, gentlemen,&#8221; said the Parson, &#8220;since you
don&#8217;t want Bull Harris to die from the treatment he gets
to-night, I suggest with all sincerity that you stick him
in again and wet his feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>While this was being done, the learned Boston scholar
switched off onto the subject of Baptists and their views
on total immersion; which promptly reminded Dewey of
a story of a &#8220;darky&#8221; camp meeting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>&#8220;Brudder Jones was very fat,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and b&#8217;gee,
when he got religion and wanted to be baptized there was
only a little brook to put him in. They found the deepest
place they could, but b&#8217;gee, Brudder Jones stomach was
still out of water. Now the deacon said his &#8216;wussest&#8217; sin
was gluttony, and that if he didn&#8217;t get all the way under
water the devil would still have his stomach and Brudder
Jones would be a glutton all his life, b&#8217;gee. So all the
brothers and sisters had to wade out into the water and
sit on Brudder Jones&#8217; stomach so that all his sins would
get washed away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who were doing the immersing in this case were
so much overcome by Dewey&#8217;s way of telling that story
that they almost let Baby Edwards, the last victim, slip
out of their hands. But they pulled him in safely in the
end, and after that the merry party set out for the
&#8220;Banded Seven den.&#8221;</p>

<p>They knew the contour of the mountains so well by this
time that even in the darkness they had no difficulty in
finding the place. They had relapsed into a grave and
solemn silence by that time, so as to get the shivering victims
into proper mood for what was next to come. Some
of the crowd climbed in, and then, like so many logs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
wood, the yearlings were poked through the opening in
the rocks and laid on the floor inside. The rest of the
plebes followed. The time for Mark&#8217;s revenge had come
at last.</p>

<p>Mark lit one of the lamps which hung from the ceiling
of the cave and then went forward to make sure that
everything was ready for the proposed hazing. The little
room in which the bones of the trapped counterfeiters lay
was up at the far end of the place. There was a heavy
wall of masonry to shut it off, with only one entrance, that
afforded by the heavy iron door, which was built like that
of a safe. Mark entered the room and after fumbling
about some came out and nodded to his companions.
He did not say a word; none of them had since they had
come in; but there was still that firm, set look about his
mouth that boded ill for those four cowardly yearlings.</p>

<p>It is difficult for one to imagine the state of mind of
these latter. Their rage and vexation at the failure of
their scheme, at the way they had been trapped, had long
since given place to one of constantly increasing dread
as they felt themselves carried further and further away,
evidently to the lonely mountain cave from which Bull
had stolen the treasure a couple of days ago. They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
in the hands of their deadliest enemies; Bull knew that
they had earned no mercy from Mark, and he knew also
that the wild Texan was along, the Texan to whom, as
they thought, murder was an everyday affair. That
dousing, too, had done its work, for it had chilled them to
the bone, and made them shiver in mind as well as in
body. The yearlings felt themselves carried a short way
on; they felt some one test the ropes that bound them,
tighten every knot, and then finally bind them to what
seemed to be a series of rings in a rough stone wall. They
heard a low voice whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re safe there. They can&#8217;t get near each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then one by one the bandages were taken from
their eyes and the gags out of their tortured mouths.</p>

<p>They saw nothing but the blackest of darkness. Absolutely
the place was so utterly without a trace of light that
the figure which stood in front to untie the gag was as
invisible as if it were a spirit. Bull heard a step across
the floor. But even that ceased a few moments later, and
the place grew silent as the grave.</p>

<p>The yearlings, though their tongues were free, did not
dare to whisper a word. They were too much awed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
the darkness. They knew that something was coming,
and they waited in suspense and dread.</p>

<p>It came. Suddenly the air was split by a sound that
was perfectly deafening in the stillness. It was the clang
of a heavy iron door, close at hand. The yearlings
started in alarm, and then stood waiting and trembling.
They knew then where they were, and what door that
was. There was an instant&#8217;s silence and then a horrified
shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Heavens! The door has slammed!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cadets recognized that voice; it was the mighty
one of Texas, but it sounded faint and dull, as if it had
passed through a heavy wall. It was succeeded by a perfect
babel of voices, all of which sounded likewise. And
the meaning of the voices, when once the cadets realized
it, chilled the very marrow of their bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it! Open it, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t! Oh, horrors, it locks on the inside!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merciful heavens! They are prisoners!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll suffocate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, quick, man, get a crowbar! Anything! Here,
give me that!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>And then came a series of poundings upon the same
iron door, accompanied by shouts and exclamations of
horror and despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t budge it. It&#8217;s a regular safe. They are locked
in for good!&#8221;</p>

<small>TORTURE OF THE YEARLINGS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Imagine, if you can, the state of mind of the agonized
four when the import of those terrible words burst upon
them. They were locked in! And tied, each one of them,
so that they could not move a hand to help themselves!
The darkness made the whole thing yet more awful. They
were entombed alive! And suffocating! Already the air
seemed to grow hot, their breath to come in choking
gasps. They screamed aloud, fairly shrieked in agony.
They tore at their bonds, beat upon the wall with their
helpless hands and feet. And all the while outside their
cries were answered by the equally terrified shouts of the
plebes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us out! Let us out!&#8221; shrieked Bull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you get loose?&#8221; they heard a voice reply; they
recognized it as Mallory&#8217;s. &#8220;Oh, man, you must get
loose! Try! Try! We can&#8217;t help you! There&#8217;s a knob
inside there! Turn it, turn it, and the door&#8217;ll open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I turn it?&#8221; screamed Bull. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
it! I&#8217;m tied! I&mdash;oh, merciful Heaven help me! We&#8217;re
suffocating.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cries from the yearlings increased in terror; outside
they heard the blows of a pickax beating against the wall.
Their hearts bounded in hope; they gasped in suspense;
but then suddenly the sound ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do a thing!&#8221; It was Texas who spoke. &#8220;The
walls are too hard. We can&#8217;t help them, they&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we!&#8221; cried Mark. &#8220;Fellows, we&#8217;re murderers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows of this yere place?&#8221; demanded Texas.
&#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll ever find &#8217;em. Fellers, let&#8217;s go back to camp
and swear we never saw &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t leave us! Don&#8217;t leave us!&#8221; wailed Bull.
&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others joined in with their horrified shrieks, but
they might as well have cried to the stones. They heard
rapidly receding footsteps, and even a heartless, triumphant
laugh. And a moment later there was nothing left
but stone for the agonized yearlings to cry to.</p>

<p>The six conspirators outside, having retreated to a far
corner of the cave, to talk over the success of their ruse,
were considering that last mentioned point then. Indian,
ever tender-hearted and nervous, wanted to let them out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
now, he was sure they&#8217;d dropped dead of fright; all their
vociferous yells from the distance could not persuade him
otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; he whispered, in an awe-stricken
voice. &#8220;They&#8217;ll suffocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for an hour in that spacious compartment,&#8221; said
the scientific Parson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I say we let &#8217;em out,&#8221; pleaded Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I say we don&#8217;t!&#8221; growled Texas. &#8220;That air feller
Bull Harris jes&#8217; deserves to be left thar fo&#8217; good! An&#8217; I
wouldn&#8217;t mind doin&#8217; it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas was usually a very mild and kind-hearted youth,
but he was wont to get wroth over the very name of
Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ole yearlin&#8217;s been the cause o&#8217; all our trouble an&#8217;
hazin&#8217; since we come hyar!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Ever since the
day Mark caught him trying to bully a young girl, an&#8217;
knocked him down fo&#8217; it, he&#8217;s tried everything but murder.
He&#8217;s too much a coward to fight fair, but he&#8217;s laid
fo&#8217; us and pitched in to lick us with his gang every time
he&#8217;s seen us alone. He&#8217;s sent Dewey and you, Mark, to
the hospital! He got the yearlin&#8217;s to take Mark out in
the woods an&#8217; beat him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>&#8220;An&#8217; he got up that air dirty scheme to skin Mark on
demerits; he did all the demeritin&#8217;, besides the beatin&#8217;.
An&#8217; he put up a plot to git Mark out o&#8217; bounds and dismissed.
An&#8217; now I say let him stay there till he&#8217;s too
durnation scared to walk!&#8221;</p>

<p>This sentiment was the sentiment of the rest; but Mark
smiled when he heard it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s punishment enough to stay in
there a minute. We&#8217;ll have to let them out pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to work the other scheme?&#8221; cried
Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll work that now,&#8221; responded Mark, whispering.
&#8220;See, there&#8217;s the light, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last remark was caused by a glance he had taken
in the direction of the dungeon. A faint glimmer of light
appeared in a crack at the top of the old, fast-falling door.
And Mark arose and crept swiftly across the room.</p>

<p>We must go inside now and see what was going on
there, for that light was destined to bring a new and
startling development for the yearlings; it was what
Texas had called &#8220;the other scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>To picture the horror of the abandoned four during
the few moments that had elapsed is beyond our effort.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
Suffice it to say, that they were still shrieking, still despairing
and yet daring to hope. And then came the new
scheme.</p>

<p>The silence and blackness had both been unbroken except
by them; but suddenly came a faint, spluttering,
crackling sound. And an instant later a faint, white light
shone about the narrow cell. It came from right in front
of the horrified four, seeming to start in some ghostly
way of its own to issue from a shining ball of no one could
say what. But it was not the light, it was what it showed
that terrified the cadets, and made them give vent to one
last despairing shriek.</p>

<p>In the first place, let it be said that the light came from
an inverted basket hiding a candle, set off by a time fuse
the ingenious Parson had made. As for the rest, well,
there were six gleaming skeletons stretched about on the
floor of that horrible place, the skulls grinning frightfully,
seeming to leer at the helpless victims.</p>

<p>The four were incapable of the least sound; their
tongues were paralyzed, and their bodies too. Their eyes
fairly started from their heads as they stared. They were
beyond the possibility of further fright, and what came
next seemed natural.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>Those skeletons began to move!</p>

<p>First one round, white head, with its shining black
holes of eyes and rows of glistening teeth, began to roll
slowly across the floor. Then it sailed up into the air;
then it dropped slowly down again, and finally settled in
one corner and grinned out at the gasping cadets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that smart of me?&#8221; it seemed to say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
it again. Watch me now. Watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it sailed up into the air once more, and swung
about in the blackness and went over toward the prisoners
and then started back. Finally it tumbled down to the
ground, hitting its own original bones with a hollow crack.
And then it was still.</p>

<p>That head was not the only moving thing in the cell.
One skeleton raised its long, trembling arm and pointed
at them; another&#8217;s legs rattled across the floor. And a
fourth one seemed to spring up all at once, as though it
had dozens of loose bones, and hurl itself with a clatter
into one corner. It lay there a scattered heap, with only
one lone white rib to mark the place where it had been.</p>

<p>That was the way it seemed to the yearlings; of course,
they did not see the black threads that ran through cracks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
in the door, where the six could stand and jerk them at
their pleasure.</p>

<p>It was all over a moment later. The four heard a knob
turn, and then, to their amazement, saw the iron door,
which they had thought would never open on them alive,
swing back and let in a flood of glorious light. And an
instant later the familiar and even welcome figure of Mallory
came in.</p>

<p>He stepped up to each and quickly cut the ropes that
hound them. And when all four were free he stepped back
and gazed at them. As for them, they never moved a
muscle, but stared at him in consternation and confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out, gentlemen,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;Come out and
make yourselves at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>That voice was real, anyway, thank Heaven for that!
The four had not yet succeeded in recovering their wits
enough to realize the state of affairs. They followed Mark
mechanically, though they were scarcely able to stand.
They found themselves in the well-lit and furnished apartment,
the rest of their enemies bowing cordially. Then
indeed they began to realize the hoax, its success, the way
they had been fooled! And they staggered back against
the wall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>The silence lasted a minute at least, and then Mark
stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I hope you understand why we
did this. It may seem cruel, but we could think of no
other way of bringing you to your senses. We could
have done much more if we had wanted to; but, we trust
this will be a lesson that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; snarled Bull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady,&#8221; said Mark, smiling, &#8220;or in there you go
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>That suggestion alone made Bull shiver, and he ventured
not another sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;if you will let us, we will conduct
you back to camp. And all I want to say besides is,
the next time you want to haze, try fair, open tactics. If
you try any more sneaking plots I shall not show the
mercy I did this time. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later the four were poked through the
crevice in the rocks again, and led blind-folded to the
boats and to camp. Which was the end of that adventure.
But Bull Harris vowed he&#8217;d get square, and that very
soon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX.<br />


<small>A NEW VENTURE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Bull Harris was resolved to &#8220;get square or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>To &#8220;get square&#8221; was in his mind constantly, until he
hit on another scheme of hazing.</p>

<p>It was several nights later that he and his cronies crept
to the tent wherein lay Mark and three of the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him move, now,&#8221; whispered Bull Harris.
&#8220;Hold him tight, for he&#8217;ll fight like fury.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And take that wild hyena they call Texas along, too,&#8221;
added another. &#8220;It was he who broke up all our fun the
other night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t get a chance to use his guns this time,&#8221;
snarled the first speaker. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve got enough of a
crowd to handle any of the others if they wake up.
Ready, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>This conversation was held in a low tone off to one side.
Then, having agreed just what each was to do, the crowd
scattered and stole silently up to the tent.</p>

<p>It was important that the yearlings should not awaken
the others; they placed themselves stealthily about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
two victims, waited an instant, and then at the signal
stooped and pinned them to the earth. The yearlings were
quite expert at that now, and the two never even got a
chance to gasp. They were lifted up and run quickly
away, held so tight that they couldn&#8217;t even kick. It was
easy when there were three or four to one plebe.</p>

<p>The plan worked perfectly, and it seemed as if no one
had discovered it. Neither of the other two sleepers had
moved. Over in the next tent, however, some one was
awakened by the noise, a plebe of Company B, another
member of the immortal Seven. He sprang to his tent
door, and an instant later found himself powerless in the
grip of two yearlings who had stayed behind to watch out
for just that accident. Evidently this attack was better
planned than the last one.</p>

<p>Master Chauncey Van Rensselaer Mount-Bonsall, of
Fifth Avenue, New York, was the unfortunate third prisoner.
He felt himself rushed over the beat of the purposely
negligent sentry and hurried into the confines of the
solitary old Fort Clinton, where he was bound and
gagged with celerity and precision and unceremoniously
tumbled to the ground by the side of Mark and Texas.</p>

<p>Everything was ready for the hazing then.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>The eight who had participated in that kidnaping,
speedily resolved themselves into two groups of four each.
The members of one group we do not know, but the other
four were our old friends, Bull Harris, Gus Murray,
Merry Vance and Baby Edwards. They had stepped to
one side to talk over the fate of their unfortunate prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven!&#8221; cried Bull, clinching his fists in anger.
&#8220;Fellows, we&#8217;ve got him at last! Do you realize it, he&#8217;s
ours to do with as we please. And if I don&#8217;t make him
sorry he ever lived this night, I hope I may die on the
spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull was striding up and down in excitement as he muttered
this. And there was no less hatred and malice in the
eyes of his three whispering companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could kill him!&#8221; cried Gus; and he said it as if he
meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been the torment of my life,&#8221; snarled Bull. &#8220;I
hate him as I never hated any one, and every time I try to
get square on him, somehow everything goes wrong. Just
think of being penned up in a black cave with a lot of
skeletons. Confound him! But he won&#8217;t get away this
time as he did before.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>This interesting and charitable dialogue was cut short
just then by one of the other four.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you fellows going to do?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there in a moment!&#8221; whispered Bull. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
talk so loud. Say, fellows (this to his own crowd) I say
we take Mallory off by ourselves. Those other fellows
won&#8217;t stand half we want to do to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; assented the dyspeptic Vance. &#8220;What in
thunder did we let them come for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have handled Mallory and Texas alone,&#8221;
replied Bull, sourly. &#8220;And we had to take Texas, else
he&#8217;d have waked up and followed us sure. But I guess
it&#8217;ll be all right. Come ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four walked over and joined the rest of the yearlings
then.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve decided what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Bull. &#8220;We won&#8217;t
need you fellows any more. We&#8217;re very much obliged to
you for helping us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; growled one of them. &#8220;I want to stay and
see the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s more danger with so many away,&#8221; said
Bull, persuasively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand my share,&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;I want to
stay. I&#8217;ve a grudge against that plebe Mallory myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull bit his lip in vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is, fellows,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we want to take these
plebes to a place we don&#8217;t know anything about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us that before you asked us?&#8221;
growled the four. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay, I don&#8217;t care what
you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact of the matter was that the four yearlings were
just a little chary about leaving their prisoner in Bull&#8217;s
hands, though they did not care to say so. They knew
Bull Harris&#8217; character. His hatred of Mallory was well
known. Who had not seen Bull, one night when the
yearling class took Mallory and started to beat him into
submission, seize a lash and leap at the helpless victim
in a perfect frenzy of hatred. And who had not heard
him all that day wrathfully telling the story of how Mallory
and his gang, in an effort to cure him of his meanness,
had frightened him almost to tears? Truly, thought
the four, Bull&#8217;s hazing was a thing to be supervised.</p>

<p>So they stayed, and finally Bull had to accept the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he growled, surlily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>The crowd lifted their helpless victims from the ground
and set out to follow Bull&#8217;s guidance. They had no idea
where they were going, and in fact Bull had none himself.
He could think of no form of torture that was quite
cruel enough for that hated Mallory, and he did not have
the brains to think of one that was as ingenious and
harmless as Mallory had worked on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d tie him up and beat the hide off him,&#8221; thought
Bull, &#8220;if I could only get rid of those confounded fellows
that are with us. As it is, I&#8217;ll have to find something
else, plague take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd had been scrambling down the steep bank
toward the river in the meanwhile. Bull thought it would
be well to douse Mallory in the water, which was one of
the tricks Mallory had tried on him. After that he said
to himself it&#8217;ll be time enough to think of something
more. They skirted the parade ground and made their
way down past the riding hall and across the railroad
track near the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to drop him on the track,&#8221; thought Bull to
himself, as he heard the roar of a train approaching.
&#8220;By Heaven, that would settle him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd had barely crossed before the engine appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
at the tunnel&#8217;s mouth, after it a long freight train
slowly rumbling past them. And at that instant Gus
Murray seized Bull convulsively by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a scheme!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Do you hear me, a
scheme?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; shouted Bull, above the noise of the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beauty,&#8221; gasped Murray. &#8220;By George, we&#8217;ll
get &#8217;em fired. They&#8217;ll go nobody knows where, and be
missed in the morning. And we can swear we didn&#8217;t do
it. Hooray! We&#8217;ll put &#8217;em on the train!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bull staggered back and cried out with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; he muttered, and an instant later, before
the horrified four could comprehend his purpose he and
Edwards had torn the helpless body of Mallory from
their arms and made a rush at a passing car. It was an
empty car, and the door was half open; to fling the plebe
in was the work of but an instant; then with Murray and
Vance he quickly slid the other two in also. Half a minute
later the train was gone.</p>

<p>The four outsiders turned and stared at Bull&#8217;s gang in
horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth have you done?&#8221; they gasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>And Bull chuckled to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sent those infernal plebes to New York,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;By Jingo, I&#8217;d like to send them to Hades. If they aren&#8217;t
fired as it is it&#8217;ll be because you kids give us away. And
now let&#8217;s go back to bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI.<br />


<small>MARK COMES TO TOWN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Timothy O&#8217;Flaherty was a tramp. That was the
plain unvarnished statement of the case. Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty
would have called himself a knight of the road, and a
comic editor would have called him Tired Tim; but to
everybody else he was a plain tramp.</p>

<p>Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty was very, very tired, having walked
nearly twenty miles that day without getting even so
much as a square meal. One whole pie was the sum total
of his daily bread and that was so bad that he had fed it
to the bulldog for revenge and walked on. He was walking
still, at present on the tracks of the West Shore Railroad
some thirty miles north of New York.</p>

<p>From what has been said of Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty you may
suppose that his heart leaped with joy when along came
a rumbling night freight. He watched it crawl past with
a professional and critical eye; there was a platform he
might ride on, but he was liable to be seen there. If only
he could find an open car. There was one! He made a
leap at the door, swung himself aboard with as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
grace as if he had lived all his life on Broadway, and then
crawled into the car.</p>

<p>Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty looked around. There was some one
else in that car!</p>

<p>&#8220;Another tramp,&#8221; thought the newcomer, and so to
awaken him he gave him a friendly prod with his toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he; but there was no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drunk,&#8221; was the next conjecture, but then he heard
a low sound that was very much like a groan.</p>

<p>That scared Timothy, and he seized the figure and
jerked it to the light of the moon that shone in through
the door. &#8220;Be the saints!&#8221; he muttered in alarm, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
sojer, an&#8217; he&#8217;s all tied up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;um&mdash;um!&#8221; groaned the figure in a &#8220;nasal&#8221; tone.</p>

<p>It was Chauncey whom the tramp had found; Chauncey
had slipped into his plebe trousers before he ran to the
tent door, which accounted for the man&#8217;s exclamation, a
&#8220;sojer.&#8221; If he had found Mark or Texas he would have
exclaimed still more, for the latter two were clad in their
underclothing.</p>

<p>Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty was a man of quick action; he saw
that he couldn&#8217;t gratify his curiosity about that strange
traveler unless he cut him loose; so he did it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>Chauncey&#8217;s first act to celebrate his liberty was a stretch
and a yawn; his second was to seize the knife and rush to
the back of the car, with the result that two more persons
appeared in the moonlight a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Timothy O&#8217;Flaherty they did not take the least
bit of notice; they appeared to have something else of
much more importance to talk about just then. And
Timothy sat in the shadow and stared at them with open
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a scrape,&#8221; muttered one of them, gazing at
his own scantily clad figure and at the landscape rushing
by.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kin we do?&#8221; cried a second. &#8220;The old Nick
take them old yearlin&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah Jove!&#8221; cried the third. &#8220;This is deucedly embarrassing.
I cawn&#8217;t go out on the street, don&#8217;t cher know,
dressed in this outlandish fashion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we can&#8217;t get a train back,&#8221; cried the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; we got no money!&#8221; said the second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah Jove!&#8221; added the third, the one Timothy recognized
as &#8220;Trousers&#8221; because he was the only one who had
them. &#8220;R&eacute;veille&#8217;ll sound, don&#8217;t cher know, and we won&#8217;t
be there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>This entertaining conversation was kept up for some
fifteen minutes more. All Mr. O&#8217;Flaherty managed to
make out was that they had been sent away from somewhere
and they hadn&#8217;t the least idea how to get back.
Presently one of them&mdash;Trousers&mdash;discovered that he did
have some money, plenty of it, whereupon Timothy&#8217;s
mouth began to water. That cleared the situation in his
eyes, but it didn&#8217;t seem to in theirs. They were afraid of
being late and getting caught by some wild animal called
r&eacute;veille; moreover, they couldn&#8217;t take a train because they
had no clothes. Here Timothy thought he&#8217;d better step in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Trousers!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The &#8220;dude&#8221; thus designated didn&#8217;t recognize himself,
so Timothy edged up and poked him to make him look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Trousers!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I kin git you ducks some
togs.&#8221;</p>

<p>To make a long story short the &#8220;ducks&#8221; &#8220;tumbled&#8221; to
that proposition in a hurry. Even Trousers, the aristocrat,
condescended to sit down and discuss ways and means
with that very sociable tramp. To make the story still
shorter Timothy propounded a plan and found it agreeable;
&#8220;jumped&#8221; the car when it was finally switched off
at Hoboken; and set out with ten dollars of the stranger&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
money, to buy second-hand clothing at one o&#8217;clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sure to come back,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;Because
we&#8217;ll make it fifteen if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>That settled whatever idea of &#8220;taking a sneak&#8221; was
lurking in the messenger&#8217;s mind. He vowed to return,
&#8220;sure as me name is Timothy O&#8217;Flaherty,&#8221; which, as we
know, it was. And he came too. He flung a pile of duds
into the car and went off whistling with the promised
reward of virtue in his pocket. It was a &#8220;bully graft&#8221; for
him anyhow, and he promised himself a regular roaring
good time. That is the last we shall see of Timothy.</p>

<p>As to the plebes their joy was equally as great. They
felt that this hazing was the supreme effort of the desperate
Bull Harris, and it failed. Now that they were
safe they could contemplate the delight of turning up smiling
at r&eacute;veille to the consternation of &#8220;the enemy.&#8221; Truly
this involuntary journey had panned out to be a very
pleasant affair indeed.</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s first thought was as to a return train. They
rushed off to the depot to find out, where they discovered
a ticket agent who gazed doubtfully at their soiled and
ragged clothing. The three realized then for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
that their benefactor had kept a good deal of that ten
dollars for himself, and poor Chauncey, to whom a wilted
collar was agony, fairly groaned as he gazed at himself.
However, they found that there was a train in ten minutes;
and another at three-thirty-due at West Point at
four-thirty-eight. That was the essential thing, and the
three wandered out to the street again.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t go far, don&#8217;t cher know,&#8221; observed Chauncey.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to miss that train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chauncey&#8217;s was not a very daring or original mind.
There was an idea floating through Mark&#8217;s head just then
that never occurred to Chauncey; it would have knocked
him over if it had.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we went up there to West Point,&#8221; began Mark,
suddenly, &#8220;we expected to stay there two years without
ever once venturing off the post.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Chauncey. &#8220;Bah Jove, we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And here we are down at Hoboken, opposite New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Chauncey again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It feels good to be loose, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; observed Mark.</p>

<p>And still Chauncey didn&#8217;t &#8220;tumble&#8221;; Texas&#8217; eyes were
beginning to dance however.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully stupid back there on the reservation, not
half as lively as New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Chauncey only said &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather kind of the yearlings to give us a holiday,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; observed Mark.</p>

<p>Another &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and then seeing that his efforts were
of no use Mark came out with his proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what I mean?
I&#8217;m not going back on that first train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not going back on that train!&#8221; gasped Chauncey.
&#8220;Bah Jove! then what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His horrified inquiries were interrupted by a wild whoop
from the delighted Texas. Texas was beginning to
wriggle his fingers, which meant that Texas was excited.
And suddenly he sprang forward and started down
the street, seizing his expostulating companion under the
arm and dragging him ahead as if he had been a child.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later those three members of the
Banded Seven&mdash;B. B. J.&mdash;were on a Christopher Street
ferryboat bound for New York and bent upon having some
&#8220;fun.&#8221; When the Seven set out for fun they usually got
it; they had all they could carry in this case.</p>

<p>It was with a truly delicious sense of freedom that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
they strolled about the deck of that lumbering boat. Only
one who has been to West Point can appreciate it. Day
after day on that army reservation, with a penalty of
dismissal for leaving it, grows woefully monotonous even
to the very busy plebe. Zest was added to their venture
by the fact that they knew they were breaking rules and
might be found out any moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still if we are,&#8221; laughed Mark, &#8220;we can lay the blame
on Bull. And now for the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>They half expected the fun would come rushing out
to welcome them the moment they got into the light of
the street. They expected a fire or a murder at the very
least. And felt really hurt because they met only a sleepy
hack driver talking to a sleepy policeman. And an empty
street car and a few slouchy-looking fellows like themselves
lounging about a saloon. However it was exciting
to be in New York anyway; what more could the three
B. J. plebes want?</p>

<p>They strolled across Christopher Street, gazing curiously.
Mark had never been in New York before and
Chauncey was worried because he couldn&#8217;t see a better
part of it, for instance, &#8220;my cousin, Mr. Morgan&#8217;s mansion
on Fifth Avenue, don&#8217;t cher know.&#8221; He even offered to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
take Mark up there, until he chanced to glance at his
clothing. Then he shivered. Truly the three were a
sight; Chauncey&#8217;s shapely plebe trousers were hidden in
a huge green threadbare overcoat (August)! Mark could
not help laughing whenever he gazed at the youthful
aristocrat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Cheer up, nobody&#8217;ll try to
rob us, which is one comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we would get robbed,&#8221; growled Texas. &#8220;Whar&#8217;s
that aire fun we came fo&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>That began to be a pressing question. They wandered
about for at least half an hour and the clocks showed
two, and still nothing had happened. The city seemed
to be provokingly orderly that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Durnation!&#8221; exclaimed Texas. &#8220;I reckon we got to
make some fun ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a person is really looking for excitement, it takes
very little to have him imagine some. The three had just
been discussing the possibility of robbery down in this
&#8220;tough&#8221; quarter when suddenly Mark seized the other
two by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, look!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The others turned; and straightway over the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
three of them flashed the conviction that at last their hour
had come. There was a burglar!</p>

<p>The three started in surprise, and a moment later they
slid silently into the shadow of an awning to watch with
palpitating hearts.</p>

<p>There was only one burglar. That is, he had no confederates
visible. But his own actions were desperate
enough for two. In the first place he crept softly up the
steps of the house, stooping and crouching as he did so.
He tried the door softly, shook it; and then finding it
resisted his purpose he stole down again, glancing about
him nervously.</p>

<p>He went down into the area, where it was dark; the
three, trembling by this time, peered forward to watch
him. They saw him try the window and to their horror
saw it go softly up. The next moment the man deliberately
sat down and removed his shoes. The plebes
could see them in his hands as he arose again and with
the stealthiness of a cat slid quickly in.</p>

<p>The three hesitated not a moment, but rose up and crept
silently and swiftly across the street. Mark stole down
into the area, his heart beating high. He peered in and
a moment later beckoned the others. They came; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
saw the burglar in the act of striking a light and creeping
up the basement stairs. In an instant more he was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; whispered the three. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark answered by an act. There was only one thing
he could do; he stooped and crept in at the window. The
three followed him immediately and their forms were
lost in the darkness of that imperiled house.</p>

<small>BURGLAR HUNTING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was an uncanny business wandering about a dark
house at night; it is especially so if it be a strange house
and if one knows for certain that there is a desperate
burglar creeping about somewhere in it. Many a man
has shrunk from that task; but the three had been bemoaning
a lack of excitement, and now here it was. So
they had no right to complain.</p>

<p>Mark waited a moment for the others to join him and
then side by side they stood and peered into the darkness.
From what they had seen of the room when the man
struck a light it was a dining-room with a flight of stairs
running up from it. Up those stairs the man had gone;
and a few moments later the three cadets were standing
hesitatingly at the foot of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have a gun,&#8221; whispered Chauncey.</p>

<p>Texas reached around to his hip pocket instinctively
at that; he groaned when he realized his defenseless condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the worst o&#8217; these yere ole Eastern ways,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
muttered. &#8220;Ef a feller had bought these yere pants in
Texas more&#8217;n likely he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; found some guns in &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Texas had but a few moments more to growl however,
for Mark stepped forward, suddenly and started up the
steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have it over with. He
can&#8217;t shoot all of us at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly they crept up the stairs, pausing at every step
to listen. They reached the top and peering around
found a dimly-lit hall without a sign of life about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s in one o&#8217; them aire rooms,&#8221; whispered
Texas. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;h!&#8221; muttered Mark.</p>

<p>His exclamation was caused by a slight noise on the
floor above, a faint tread.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s upon the next floor!&#8221; gasped the three. &#8220;Shall
we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They did; Mark led the way and with still more trembling
caution they stole on, crouching in the shadow of
the banisters, trying to stifle the very beatings of their
hearts and breathing fast with excitement.</p>

<p>Up, up. There were twenty-one stairs to that flight;
Mark knew that, because they stopped a long while on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
each listening for another clew to the burglar&#8217;s whereabouts,
and trembling as they imagined him peering over
at them.</p>

<p>Not a sign of him did they see or hear, however, until
they reached the level of the floor, where they could lean
forward and look around the balustrade. First they
heard a sound of heavy breathing, as from a sleeper.
That was in the rear room, and Mark, peering in, saw the
person clearly.</p>

<p>There was a faint light in the room, a light from a
dimly-burning gas jet. The room was apparently deserted
except for the sleeper. It was a woman, for Mark
could see her hair upon the pillow. But where was the
burglar?</p>

<p>The answer came with startling suddenness, suddenness
that precipitated a calamity. The room next to the rear
one was dark and silent until, without a moment&#8217;s warning,
all at once a light flashed out. And there was the
burglar. The reckless villain had lit the gas, so sure
was he of his safety. And he was standing now in the
middle of the floor, stealthily taking off his coat before
starting to work.</p>

<p>Naturally that sudden flash of light startled the three;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
it startled them so much that Chauncey leaped back with
a gasp of alarm; and a moment later, his heel catching in
the end of his huge green overcoat, he tripped and staggered,
clutched wildly at nothing, and with a shriek of
alarm tumbled backward, rolling over and over with a
series of crashes that made the building shake. And then
there was fun.</p>

<p>In the first place, as to the burglar; he started back in
horror, realizing his discovery; in the second place, as to
the woman; she sat up in bed with the celerity of a jack-in-the-box,
and an instant later gave vent to a series of
screams that awoke the neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! Help! Burglars! Murder! Thieves! Fire!
Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the third place, as to the cadets. Their first thought
was of Chauncey, and they turned and bounded down the
steps to the bottom. They found him &#8220;rattled&#8221; but unhurt,
and they picked him up and set him on his feet.
Their second thought was of the burglar, that ruthless
villain who perhaps even now was making his escape
by a window. The thought made them jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; shouted Mark.</p>

<p>And to a man they sprang up the stairs, two or three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
steps at a time, shouting &#8220;Burglars!&#8221; as they went. They
reached the top and bounded into the room, where they
found the man in the very act of rushing out of the door.
Mark sprang at him, seized him by the throat and bore
him to the ground. And the two others plunged upon the
pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him! Hold him! Help! Help!&#8221; was the cry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the woman had arisen from the bed, very
naturally, and was now rushing about the hall in typical
angelic costume, occasionally poking her head out of the
windows and shrieking for burglars and help, using a
voice that had a very strong Irish brogue.</p>

<p>In response to her stentorian tones help was not slow
in arriving. A crash upon the door was heard; the door
gave way, and up the stairs rushed two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help us hold him!&#8221; roared Texas, who was at this
moment trying his level best to push the criminal&#8217;s nose
through the carpet. &#8220;Help us to hold him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But to his infinite surprise the two newcomers made a
savage rush on him, and in an instant more the true state
of affairs flashed over Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re friends of the burglar!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Whoop!
Come on, thar!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>The two men were not slow to accept his invitation.
They added their bodies to the already complicated heap
of arms and legs that were writhing about on the floor,
and after that the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> was even livelier than ever. Even
the woman took a hand; her Irish blood would not let her
stay out of the battle long, and she pitched in with a
broom, whacking everything promiscuously.</p>

<p>What would have been the end of all this riot I do not
pretend to say; I only know that Mark was devoting
himself persistently to the task of holding the burglar underneath
him, in spite of all manner of punches and kicks,
and that Texas was dashing back and forth across the
room, plowing his way recklessly through every human
being he saw when the &#8220;scrap&#8221; was brought to an untimely
end by the arrival of one more person.</p>

<p>This latter was a policeman, a policeman of the fat and
unwieldy type found only in New York. He had plunged
up the stairs, club in hand, and now stood red and panting,
menacing the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! stop!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Yield to the majesty of the
la-aw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one was glad to do that, as it appeared; the battling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
ceased abruptly and all parties concerned rose up
and glared at each other in the dim light.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221; cried the &#8220;cop.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he had realized the terrible consequence of that question
he would never have asked it. For each and every
person concerned sprang forward to answer it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the burglar!&#8221; cried Mark, pointing excitedly
at the original cause of all the trouble, who was wiping
his fevered brow with diligence. &#8220;There&#8217;s the burglar!
Arrest him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; roared Texas. &#8220;Grab him! I&#8217;ll tell you
how it was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howly saints!&#8221; shrieked the woman, &#8220;don&#8217;t let them
get away! They&#8217;ve broken me head, in faith! An&#8217; look
at me poor husband&#8217;s oi!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me a burglar!&#8221; roared the person thus alluded to by
Mark, shaking one fist at Mark and the other at the
officer. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a burglar they call me, is it? So that&#8217;s
their trick, be jabbers! An&#8217; a foine state of affairs it is
when a man can&#8217;t come into his own house without being
called a burglar, bad cess to it. Bridget, git me that flat-iron
there an&#8217; soak the spalpeen! Be the saints!&#8221;</p>

<p>During that tirade of incoherent Irish the three cadets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
had suddenly collapsed. The situation had flashed over
them in all its horror and awfulness. The &#8220;burglar&#8221; lived
in the house! The woman was his wife! And they were
the burglars!</p>

<p>The three gazed at each other in consternation and
sprang back instinctively. The policeman took that for a
move to escape and he whipped out his revolver with a
suddenness that made Texas&#8217; mouth water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>His command received even more emphasis from the
fact that another policeman rushed up the stairs at that
moment. The three stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, officer,&#8221; said Mark, as calmly as he could.
&#8220;This is all a mistake. We aren&#8217;t burglars; we are perfectly
respectable young men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like it,&#8221; put in the other, incredulously.</p>

<p>Mark&#8217;s heart sank within him at that. He glanced at
his two companions and realized how hopeless was their
case. New rags and tatters had been added by the battle.
Disheveled hair, and dirt and blood-stained faces made
them about as disreputable specimens as could be found
in New York. Respectable young men! Pooh!</p>

<p>&#8220;I could explain it,&#8221; groaned Mark. &#8220;We thought this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
man was a burglar and we followed him in. We aren&#8217;t
tramps if we do look it. We are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he stopped abruptly; to tell that they were
cadets would be their ruination anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lot of thaves an&#8217; robbers! Sure an&#8217; thot&#8217;s
what yez are!&#8221; shouted the irate &#8220;burglar,&#8221; filling in the
sentence and at the same time making a rush at Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the policeman, stopping him. &#8220;Enough
of this. You fellers can tell your yarn to the judge to-morrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark gasped as he realized the full import of that sentence.
It was two o&#8217;clock and their train left in an hour
or two&mdash;their last chance! And they could tell their story
to the judge in the morning!</p>

<p>The policeman jerked a pair of handcuffs from his
pockets and stepped up to Mark. The latter saw that
resistance was hopeless and though it was torture to him
he held out his wrists and said nothing. Texas, having
no gun, could do nothing less. Chauncey was the only
one who &#8220;kicked,&#8221; and he kicked like a steer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah Jove!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;This is an insult, a deuced insult!
I won&#8217;t stand it, don&#8217;t cher know! Stop, I say. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
won&#8217;t go, bah Jove! I&#8217;ll send for my father and have
every man on the blasted police force fired! I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The snap of the handcuffs and the feeling of the cold
steel subdued Chauncey and he subsided into growls. The
officer took him by the arm, saying something as he did
so about an &#8220;English crook.&#8221; And then the three filed
downstairs, the indignant and much-bruised Irishman following
and enlivening the proceedings with healthy anathemas.</p>

<p>That walk to the station house the three will never forget
as long as they live, it was so unspeakably degrading;
it was only a short way, just around the corner, but it
was bad enough. Idlers and loafers fell in behind to jeer
at them, scarcely giving them chance to reflect upon the
desperately-horrible situation they were in.</p>

<p>Mark was glad when at last the door of the station
house shut upon them to hide them from curious eyes.
There was almost no one in here to stare at them, but a
sleepy sergeant at the desk; he looked up with interest
when they entered, and were marched up before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burglars,&#8221; said one of the officers, briefly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>Chauncey&#8217;s wrath had been pent up for some ten minutes
then, and at that word it boiled over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no burglar!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;I tell you, you fools,
I&#8217;m no burglar! Bah Jove, this is an outrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faith an&#8217; yez are a burglar!&#8221; shouted the Irishman,
likewise indignant. &#8220;An&#8217; faith, Mr. Sergeant, the divils
broke into me house and near broke me head, too, bad
cess to &#8217;em. An&#8217; thot, too, whin Oi&#8217;d been to the club
an&#8217; were a-thryin&#8217; to git to sleep without wakin&#8217; me wife.
An&#8217; faith she&#8217;ll be after me wid a shtick, thot she will,
to-morrer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t burglars, I say!&#8221; protested Chauncey. &#8220;We
thought he was a burglar. We&#8217;re cade&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mark gave him a nudge that nearly knocked him
over; he looked up and caught sight of a spruce young
man with pencil and notebook working diligently. It
was a reporter and Chauncey took the hint and shut up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221; inquired the sergeant, seeing him quiet at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name, bah Jove?&#8221; exclaimed the other. &#8220;Chauncey
Van Ren&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Mark gave him a poke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter Smith,&#8221; said Chauncey.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>&#8220;And yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Jones,&#8221; said Texas.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark glanced at the others with one last dying trace
of a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Timothy O&#8217;Flaherty,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You understand,&#8221; he
added, to ease his conscience, &#8220;they&#8217;re all fictitious, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded as he wrote the names.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find the right ones in the Rogues&#8217; Gallery,&#8221; he
remarked sarcastically.</p>

<p>That fired Chauncey again, and he went off into another
tirade of abuse and indignation, which was finally closed
by the officers offering to &#8220;soak him&#8221; if he didn&#8217;t shut
up. Then they were led off to a cell&mdash;number seven, curiously
enough. And as the door shut with a clank the
three gasped and realized that it was the death knell of
their earthly hopes.</p>

<small>CHAUNCEY HAS AN IDEA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Three more utterly discouraged and disgusted plebes
than our friends would be hard to manufacture. There
wasn&#8217;t a ray of hope, any more than a ray of light to
illumine that dark cell. There was only one possibility
to be considered, apparently&mdash;they would be hauled up in
the police court the next morning and required to give
an account of themselves. If they gave it, said they were
cadets, it would be good-by West Point; for they had
broken a dozen rules. If on the other hand they chose
to remain Peter Smith, John Jones and Timothy O&#8217;Flaherty,
young toughs, it would be something like &#8220;One
thousand dollars&#8217; bail,&#8221; or else &#8220;remanded without bail
for trial&#8221;&mdash;and no West Point all the same!</p>

<p>The three had characteristic methods of showing their
disgust. Texas had gone to sleep in a corner, seeing no
use in worrying. Mark was sitting moodily on the floor,
trying his best to think of something to do. Chauncey
was prancing up and down the cell about as indignant as
ever was a &#8220;haughty aristocrat,&#8221; vowing vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
against everybody and everything in a blue uniform as
sure as his name was Chaun&mdash;er, Peter Smith.</p>

<p>Mad and excited as Chauncey was, it was from him
that the first gleam of hope came. And when Chauncey
hit upon his idea he fairly kicked himself for his stupidity
in not hitting on it before. A moment later his friends,
and in fact the whole station house, were startled by his
wild yells for &#8220;somebody&#8221; to come there.</p>

<p>An officer came in a hurry thinking of murder or
what not.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah Jove!&#8221; remarked our young friend, eying him
with haughty scorn that made a hilarious contrast with
his outlandish green August overcoat. &#8220;Bah Jove, don&#8217;t
be so peremptory, so rude, ye know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W&mdash;why!&#8221; gasped the amazed policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know, don&#8217;t ye know,&#8221; said Chauncey, &#8220;if
I can send a telegram, bah Jove?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; growled the other. &#8220;That is, if you&#8217;ve got any
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chauncey pulled out his &#8220;roll,&#8221; which had been missed
when they searched him, and tossed a five-dollar bill carelessly
to the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>&#8220;Take that,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Bah Jove, I don&#8217;t want it, ye
know. Come now, write what I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man took the bill in a hurry and drew out a pencil
and notebook, while Chauncey&#8217;s two fellow-prisoners
stared anxiously. Chauncey dictated with studied scorn
and indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am&mdash;arrested,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for&mdash;burglary&mdash;ye&mdash;know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman wrote the &#8220;ye know,&#8221; obediently, though
he gasped in amazement and muttered &#8220;lunatic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under&mdash;name&mdash;of&mdash;Peter&mdash;Smith&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Street&mdash;station.
Come&mdash;instantly Chauncey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who shall I send it to?&#8221; inquired the &#8220;stenographer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; Chauncey mused. &#8220;Bah Jove, not to
fawther, ye know. They&#8217;d see the name, ruin the family
reputation. A deuced mess! Oh yes, bah Jove, I&#8217;ll have
all me uncles, ye know! Ready there? First, Mr. Perry
Bellwood, &mdash;&mdash; Fifth Avenue&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; gasped the officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write what I say,&#8221; commanded Chauncey, sternly;
&#8220;and no comments! Second, Mr. W. K. Vanderpool, &mdash;&mdash; Fifth
Avenue. Third&mdash;bah Jove&mdash;Mr. W. C. Stickhey, &mdash;&mdash; Fifth
Avenue. Fourth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>&#8220;How many do you want?&#8221; expostulated the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; roared the &#8220;dude.&#8221; &#8220;Do as I say! I take
no chances. Fourth, Mr. Bradley-Marvin, &mdash;&mdash; Fifth
Avenue. And that&#8217;ll do, I guess, ye know. Run for your
life, then, deuce take it, and I&#8217;ll give you another five if
they get here in a hawf hour, bah Jove.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was probably no more amazed policeman on the
metropolitan force than that one. But he hustled according
to orders none the less. Certainly there was no more
satisfied plebe in the whole academy class than Mr. Chauncey
Van Rensselaer Mount-Bonsall of New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right now, bah Jove,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be here soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with those words of comfort Chauncey subsided
and was asleep from sheer exhaustion two minutes later.
Though he slept, forgetful of the whole affair, there were
a few others who did not sleep, messenger boys and millionaires
especially.</p>

<p>The sergeant at the desk had had no one but one
&#8220;drunk&#8221; to register during the next half hour, and so he
was pretty nearly asleep himself. The doorman was
slumbering peacefully in his chair, and two or three
roundsmen and officers were sitting together in one corner
whispering. That was the state of affairs in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
police station when something happened all of a sudden
that made everybody leap up with interest.</p>

<p>A carriage came slamming up the street at race-horse
speed. Any one who has lain awake at night, or rather
in the early hours of morning, when the city is as silent
as a graveyard, has noticed the clatter made by a single
wagon. An approaching tornado or earthquake could
not have made much more of a rumpus than this one.
The sergeant sat up in alarm and the doorman flung upon
the door and rushed out to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>They were soon to learn&mdash;the driver yanked up his galloping
horses directly in front of the building. At the
same instant the coach door was flung open with a bang.
It was an elderly gentleman who hopped out, and he
made a dash for the entrance, nearly bowling the doorman
over in his haste.</p>

<p>Now it is not often that a &#8220;swell bloke&#8221; like that visits
a station house at such hours. The sergeant gazed at
him in alarm, expecting a burglary, a murder, or perhaps
even a dynamite plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The man dashed up to the desk, breathless from his
unusual exertion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>&#8220;My boy!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your boy?&#8221; echoed the sergeant. &#8220;Where is he?
What on earth?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant thought he had a lunatic then.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy!&#8221; reiterated the man excitedly. &#8220;Chauncey!
He&#8217;s a prisoner here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer shook his head with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nobody named Chauncey,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
come to the wrong place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man happened to think of the telegram; he glanced
at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he cried, suddenly. &#8220;I forgot. Peter Smith
is the name he gave. You&#8217;ve a Peter Smith here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant gazed at the excited man in indescribable
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peter Smith!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Why, yes. But he&#8217;s a
tramp. He&#8217;s arrested for burglary, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The strange gentleman was evidently angry at having
been stirred out of bed so early in the morning. Moreover
he was insulted at the outrageous idea of his nephew&#8217;s
being in a common prison house as a burglar. Altogether
he was mad through, and didn&#8217;t take the trouble to be
cautious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>&#8220;Let him out this instant, I say,&#8221; he demanded, indignantly.
&#8220;How dare you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the sergeant was a pompous individual and he
had no idea of being &#8220;bossed&#8221; like that by any one, whoever
he might be, least of all in the presence of his men.
Moreover, he was an Irishman, and this angry individual&#8217;s
superior way got him wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded, with more conciseness
than courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Perry Bellwood,&#8221; said the other with just as much
asperity. &#8220;And what is more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who in thunder is Perry Bellwood?&#8221; roared the sergeant.</p>

<p>That took all the wind out of the elderly and aristocratic
gentleman&#8217;s sails.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know Perry Bellwood?&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Perry
Bellwood, the banker!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never saw him,&#8221; retorted the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t release my nephew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I won&#8217;t release your nephew!&#8221; roared the
officer, hammering on his desk for emphasis. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
release him for you or any other banker in New York,
or the whole crowd of them together. Do you hear that?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
I&#8217;d like to know what you think a police sergeant is,
anyhow. A nice state of affairs it would be if I had to set
loose every burglar and murderer in prison because of
some man who thinks he owns the earth because he is a
banker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant was red in the face from anger as he
finished this pointed declaration. Mr. Bellwood was pacing
up and down the room furiously. He turned upon
the man suddenly when he finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you all I own,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll do as I say,
and in an hour, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bet you my job I don&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped the sergeant.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see who&#8217;s running this place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>By that time the outraged banker had made a dash for
his carriage. The outraged sergeant planked himself
down on his chair and gazed about him indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very idea!&#8221; vowed he. &#8220;The very idea! That
fellow talked to me as if he were the mayor. I&#8217;d a good
mind to lock him up. I wouldn&#8217;t let those burglars loose
now for all Fifth Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was given a chance to prove that last assertion of
his, a good deal more of a chance than he expected when
he made it. He had hardly gotten the words out of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
mouth, and the rattle of the carriage had not yet died
away before another one dashed up to the door.</p>

<p>The sergeant thought it was the same fellow back, and
he got up angrily. The door was flung open and in
dashed another man, even more aristocratic in bearing
than the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Mr. Stickhey,&#8221; said he, gravely, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ve come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you want to raise a rumpus about that confounded
Chauncey, too!&#8221; cried the sergeant, getting red
to the ends of his whiskers.</p>

<p>&#8220;W-why! What&#8217;s this?&#8221; gasped the astonished millionaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose you want me to let him go, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W-why!&#8221; gasped the astonished millionaire again.
&#8220;What&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you do you might as well understand that I
don&#8217;t mean to do it. And you needn&#8217;t be wasting any
breath about it either. I&#8217;ve stood about all of this I mean
to stand from anybody. I don&#8217;t set my prisoners loose for
the devil himself, and I won&#8217;t for you. Now then!&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the look of amazement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
that was on the dignified Mr. Stickhey&#8217;s face. He stared,
and then he started again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, officer!&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I!&#8221; vowed the sergeant. &#8220;Dead sure! And all
your talk won&#8217;t change the fact, either, that Peter Smith,
or Chauncey, or whoever he is, stays where he is till morning.
And the sooner you realize it the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The millionaire stared yet half a minute more, and then
he whirled about on his heel and strode out, without another
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see about this,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The sergeant did not return to his seat; he was too
mad. He pranced up and down the room like a wild man,
vowing vengeance on all the dudes and bankers in existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if any more of them are coming,&#8221; exclaimed
he. &#8220;By jingo, I just wish they would. I&#8217;m just in the
humor&mdash;gee whiz!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was another! Yet older and more sedate than either
of the others he marched in and gazed haughtily about
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a nephew&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began; and there he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;You have! Get out!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear me? Get out of here, I say! Not a
word, or I&#8217;ll have you&mdash;ah! I wonder if there&#8217;ll be any
more of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last was a chuckle of satisfaction as Millionaire
No. 3 fled precipitately. The sergeant rubbed his hands
gleefully. This sport bade fair to last all night, he
realized to his great satisfaction as he faced about and
waited.</p>

<p>He was waiting for number four to show up. He was
getting madder still and this time he was fingering his
club suggestively. At the very first gleam of a white
shirt front he drew it and made a dash for the door.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Vanderpool, number four.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; said the irate sergeant, menacingly, and he
swung up his weapon. The gentleman thought he had
met with a maniac; he gave one glance and then made a
dash for the carriage. The officer faced about, replaced
his club, and softly murmured &#8220;Next.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the &#8220;next&#8221; never came. The sergeant got weary
of pacing about and finally sat down again. Half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
passed and he began to doze; the fun for that night was
over, thought he, and laughed when he thought how mad
be had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just like to see any Fifth Avenue dudes running
this place,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I never heard of such a piece
of impertinence in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Through all this the plebes were peacefully sleeping.
What poor Chauncey would have done if he had seen his
four uncles insulted by that irate policeman is left to the
imagination of the reader. It would most infallibly have
been the death of Chauncey, and so perhaps it is just as
well that he didn&#8217;t awaken.</p>

<p>The clock over the station house door was at three. It
will be remembered that the train left at three-thirty.
The only train that could possibly save those unfortunate
plebes. Three-thirty was the time the ferryboat left. But
the station house was two miles and more from the ferry-slip.
Altogether things were getting very interesting.
For the sergeant dozed on, and the prisoners slept on and
the clock went on to three-fifteen. It was a wonder Mark
Mallory didn&#8217;t have a nightmare.</p>

<p>It is of the nature of thunderbolts to strike swiftly.
There is no parleying, no stopping for introductions, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
delays. Therefore there will be none in describing what
happened next.</p>

<p>The sergeant sat up with a start; so did the doorman,
and so did everybody else in the place. There was the
rattle of another carriage!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />


<small>BACK AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The sergeant had gotten over his anger, but he meant
to be consistent, all the same. If this was another one of
those &#8220;bloated aristocrats&#8221; he&#8217;d better look out for trouble,
that was all.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up in the usual fashion, the sergeant
seized his club. There was a flash of white shirt front
and the sergeant made a leap for the door. The next moment
he staggered back as if he had been shot. It was
Millionaire No. 1, hatless and breathless, almost coatless
and senseless, dragging in his wake&mdash;the captain of the
precinct!</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted and gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you,&#8221; cried Millionaire No. 1.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a prisoner here named Smith?&#8221; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes,&#8221; stammered the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send him here, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor officer was too much amazed and thunder-struck
to be chagrined at his defeat. He made a rush for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
the cell; shouted to the prisoners; and half a minute later
Chauncey, green August overcoat and all, was in his
uncle&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>The sergeant turned to the smiling police captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me to present&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a yell; Chauncey had glanced up
at the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We&#8217;ve ten minutes to make
the train!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chauncey, aristocratic and Chesterfieldian Chauncey,
alas, I blush to record it, had forgotten in one instant that
there was such a thing on earth as a rule of etiquette. He
forgot that there was such a person on earth as a police
captain. He never even looked at him. His two friends
at his side, he made one wild dash for the door.</p>

<p>He was not destined to get out of it, however. During
the excitement no one had noticed the approach of another
white shirt front and in rushed Millionaire No. 2.</p>

<p>No. 2 had the chief of police!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a prisoner here named Smith&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; cried the
latter excitedly. &#8220;Release&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the millionaire caught sight of Chauncey, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
again there were handshakes and apologies, another scurrying
toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop, I tell you!&#8221; roared Chauncey. &#8220;I&#8217;ll miss
the train&mdash;quick&mdash;bah Jove, ye know, I&#8217;ll be ruined&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another clatter of wheels at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; gasped the unfortunate cadet. &#8220;It&#8217;s
somebody else! Bah Jove! Deuce take the luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing has been said of the unfortunate sergeant during
this. He was leaning against his desk in a state of
collapse. Millionaire No. 3 had entered the room.</p>

<p>Millionaire No. 3 had a police commissioner!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a prisoner here named Smith,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Release&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the plebes were desperate. They could stand
it no longer. Chauncey had forced his way to the door
and made a dash for one of the carriages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, and then he stopped long enough
to see another carriage rush up&mdash;Millionaire No. 4. Millionaire
No. 4 had somebody&mdash;Chauncey didn&#8217;t know who.
But the agonized sergeant did.</p>

<p>It was no less a personage than his honor, the mayor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>(His honor the mayor was mad, too, and you may bet
the sergeant caught it.)</p>

<p>With that our three friends had nothing to do. They
had piled into the carriage, Millionaire No. 1 with them,
and likewise the captain, to make sure that they weren&#8217;t
arrested for fast driving. And away they rattled down
the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christopher Street&mdash;seven minutes!&#8221; roared Chauncey.
&#8220;For your life&mdash;bah Jove!&#8221;</p>

<p>After which there was fun to spare. New York streets
aren&#8217;t made for race tracks, and the way that carriage
swayed and bumped was a caution. The driver had taken
them at their word and was going for dear life. Three
times the captain had to lean out of the window to quell
some policeman who was shouting at them to slow up.</p>

<p>As for the plebes, there was nothing for them to do but
sit still and wait in trembling anxiousness. Chauncey&#8217;s
uncle had a watch in his hand with the aid of which he
told off the streets and the seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we make it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we won&#8217;t have ten seconds
to spare. Faster, there, faster!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor cadets nearly had heart failure at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we miss it,&#8221; groaned Mark, &#8220;we are gone forever.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
The whole story&#8217;ll come out and we&#8217;ll be expelled sure
as we&#8217;re alive. What time did you say it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive, there, drive!&#8221; roared Chauncey.</p>

<p>All things come to an end. Those that haven&#8217;t will
some day. It seemed an age to the suffering plebes, but
that drive was over at last. And the end of it was so
terrible that they would have preferred the suspense.</p>

<p>The carriage was yanked up and brought to stop in
front of the ferry gates just as the boat was gliding from
her slip.</p>

<p>The look that was upon the faces of the three would
have moved a Sphinx to tears. They sank back in the
carriage and never said one word. It was all over. West
Point was gone. To the three that meant that life was
no longer worth the living.</p>

<p>It seemed almost too terrible to be true. Mark Mallory
pinched himself to make sure he was alive; that all this
dream had really happened, that he really was beyond
hope.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the police captain gave vent to a
startled exclamation and whacked his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desbrosses Street!&#8221; he roared to the startled driver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
and an instant later the carriage was speeding away down
along the wharves.</p>

<p>Where they were going, or why, none of them had the
least idea, except the captain; and he said nothing. The
trip was a short one, only three or four blocks. At the
end of it he sprang from the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, quick!&#8221; he cried, and made a dash for one of
the piers.</p>

<p>The rest did not need to be urged to follow. They
beat the captain there in their haste. For they saw then
where he was going; a police tug was lying at the wharf.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; roared the captain, leaping aboard. &#8220;Follow
that ferry!&#8221;</p>

<p>And half a minute later the engines of the tug were
throbbing and the tug was sweeping out into the river.</p>

<p>A few minutes after that there were three tough-looking
tramps contentedly dozing in a Pullman car of the West
Shore express.</p>

<p>The same three sneaked into Camp McPherson at the
very moment when Cadet Corporal Vance (of the Bull
Harris gang) was superintending the loading of the
r&eacute;veille gun.</p>

<small>A CHALLENGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there, wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;um. Don&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! Git up, man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Texas, didn&#8217;t I tell you I wanted to sleep this
hour? Haven&#8217;t I been awake now two nights in succession
helping you haze the yearlings? Now I want to take
a nap; so let me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up!&#8221; repeated Texas. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you got sense
enough, Mark Mallory, to know I&#8217;m not pesterin&#8217; you fo&#8217;
nothin&#8217;? Git yo&#8217; eyes open thar and listen. I got something
to tell you. I know you&#8217;re sleepy&mdash;thar ain&#8217;t no
need tellin&#8217; me that aire ag&#8217;in. I know you were up night
afore last hazin&#8217; them ole yearlin&#8217;s, an&#8217; last night, too,
&#8217;cause they tied us up an&#8217; fired us into that freight train
goin&#8217; to New York. But this hyar&#8217;s more &#8217;portant than
sleepin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a committee from the first class wants to see
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar, naow! I knew you&#8217;d get yo&#8217; eyes open,&#8221; laughed
the other triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they want?&#8221; inquired Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what they want well as I do,&#8221; responded
Texas. &#8220;They want you. They want you &#8217;cause you&#8217;re
the most B. J. plebe ever came to West Point, &#8217;cause you
dared to defy &#8217;em, to refuse to be hazed, to lick &#8217;em when
they tried it, an&#8217; to all &#8217;round raise the biggest rumpus this
hyar ole place ever see. That&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; laughed Mark, &#8220;that they want me
to fight some more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Course they do!&#8221; roared Texas. &#8220;You old idiot, you!
Why ain&#8217;t yo&#8217; up hustlin&#8217; fo&#8217; the chance? You don&#8217;t appreciate
yo&#8217; opportunity, sah. Ef I had the chance to
wallop them ole cadets like you&#8217;ve got&mdash;wow! You know
what I&#8217;d do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fire-eating, wild and woolly cowboy hunting
for fight,&#8221; responded Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; grinned the other. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do it
when the time comes. I never see you run yit when you
ought to be fightin&#8217;, an&#8217; neither did them ole cadets. An&#8217;
say, Mark! There&#8217;s fun ahead! Whoop! You remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
ever since you had the nerve to go to the hop, somethin&#8217;
no plebe ever dared do afore, them ole first class
fellers vowed they&#8217;d make you sorry. You made &#8217;em
madder since by lickin&#8217; one of &#8217;em when they dared you
to. An&#8217; now they&#8217;re comin&#8217; &#8217;roun&#8217; to git square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean they&#8217;re going to make me fight every
man in the class, as they said?&#8221; inquired Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jes&#8217; what I do!&#8221; cried Texas, gleefully. &#8220;Jes&#8217;
exactly! Come out hyer an&#8217; see &#8217;em yo&#8217;self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark had been making his toilet before the little looking-glass
that hung on the tent pole; he turned then and
accompanied his friend out of camp and over to Trophy
Point, where sat in all stateliness and dignity three solemn-looking
seniors, a committee from the first class to
Mark Mallory, the desperate and defiant and as yet untamed
&#8220;B. J.&#8221; plebe. But he wasn&#8217;t going to remain untamed
very long if that committee had anything to do
with it.</p>

<p>They arose at his approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory?&#8221; said the spokesman.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come from the first class, I believe,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Let us proceed right to business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>The committee, through its spokesman, cleared its
throat with a solemn &#8220;Ahem!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I presume you have not forgotten
that a short while ago you ventured to defy our
class openly. The class has not forgotten it, for such conduct
in a plebe cannot be tolerated here. Your conduct
ever since you came has been unbearably defiant; you have
set at naught every cadet law of the academy. And therefore,
as the class warned you beforehand, you must expect
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Mallory bowed; he&#8217;d had a good deal of it already,
he thought to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The class has been waiting,&#8221; continued the other, &#8220;for
you to recover from the effects of a dislocated shoulder, an
injury due to another unpleasant&mdash;ahem&mdash;accident&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, to be more specific,&#8221; inserted Mark, very mildly,
&#8220;due to the fact that I was&mdash;er&mdash;attacked by some&mdash;ahem&mdash;fifty
members of the first class in a body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite so many,&#8221; said the chairman, flushing. &#8220;The
incident is regretted by the class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By me also,&#8221; said Mark, rubbing his shoulder suggestively.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears,&#8221; the other continued hurriedly, &#8220;that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
are now recovered. Therefore, to be brief, the class has
sent us to inquire as to your wishes concerning the duty
you undertook when you ventured to defy them. You
know what I mean. You stand pledged, and you will be
compelled to defend yourself before every member of our
class in turn until you agree to apologize and become a
plebe once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spokesman stopped and Mark answered without
hesitation, looking him squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the class,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I am ready to meet any
one it may select, to-day if necessary, and in any place
they choose. Tell them also if they could manage to select
one of those who helped to injure my shoulder I should
consider it a favor. Tell them that I have nothing to
apologize for. Tell them that I renew my defiance,
with all possible courtesy, of course; tell them I once more
refuse to be hazed, and shall refuse even when I am
beaten; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the excitable ex-cowboy, who had been listening
with most evident delight, sprang forward with a whoop.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; tell &#8217;em,&#8221; he roared, &#8220;doggone their boots, ef
they lick Mark fair or foul they ain&#8217;t hardly begun what
they&#8217;ll have to do! Tell &#8217;em, sah, there&#8217;s a gennelman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
what never yit run from man or devil, named Jeremiah
Powers, sah, son o&#8217; the Honorable Scrap Powers, o&#8217; Hurricane
County, Texas. Tell &#8217;em he&#8217;s jes&#8217; roaring for a
scrap, an&#8217; that he&#8217;ll start in whar Mallory quits! An&#8217;
tell &#8217;em&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the committee had turned away and started across
the parade ground by that time. The committee didn&#8217;t
consider it necessary to listen to Mr. Jeremiah Powers.</p>

<p>Mark had listened however; and as he took Texas by
the hand the excitable Texas saw in his eyes that he appreciated
the offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Mark at last, &#8220;if I am to do some
fighting I&#8217;d best go back and finish that nap. I&#8217;ll need
to make up for the sleep I&#8217;ve missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>An important event had happened to that company
that day, one that had made a great change in their lives.
A month and a half of drill and discipline, the most rigorous
possible, had been judged to have had its effect. And
that day the plebes were honored by being put in the cadet
battalion.</p>

<p>Previously they had &#8220;herded&#8221; alone, a separate roll call,
separate drills, separate seats in mess hall. But now all
was changed. The plebe company was broken up, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
members each going to their own company in the battalion,
to hear their names called with the others at roll
call, to march down to meals and sit with them, too.
And that afternoon for the first time the plebes were to
march on parade, Mark and Texas under the command of
Fischer, cadet-captain of Company A.</p>

<p>Concerning Fischer, the high and mighty first classman,
it may be well to say a word, for he will figure prominently
in this story. Fischer was a member of the first class, and
its idol. Tall, handsome and athletic, he made an ideal
captain; even the plebes thought that, and strange to say,
our B. J. plebes most of all. For Fischer was a fair-minded,
gentlemanly fellow and more than once he had
interfered to see that Mallory got fair play with his
enemies.</p>

<p>He came in that same afternoon to have a word with
Mark as to the latest excitement; it was an unusual thing
indeed for a cadet-captain even to speak to a plebe, but
Fischer chose to be different. And, moreover, Mallory
had earned for himself many privileges most plebes had
never dreamed of.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a letter from your friend, Wicks Merritt,&#8221; said
Fischer. &#8220;His furlough is coming to an end. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Wicks is very much agitated for fear you&#8217;ll be hazed out
of West Point before he gets here. But I told him there
wasn&#8217;t much danger. I think you&#8217;ll stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall try,&#8221; laughed Mark, while Texas sat by in
awe and gazed at the young officer&#8217;s chevrons and sash.
&#8220;I shall try. Have you heard of my engagement&mdash;the
latest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the other, &#8220;I have. That&#8217;s what I
came in for. I don&#8217;t envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t myself,&#8221; said the plebe thoughtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like to fight. I&#8217;d a thousand times rather not, and I
always say &#8216;no&#8217; when I can. But I&#8217;ve vowed I wouldn&#8217;t
stand the kind of hazing I got, and I don&#8217;t mean to so long
as I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you luck,&#8221; said Fischer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told the men
in my own class that, for I haven&#8217;t forgotten, as they
seem to, the time you rescued that girl in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who&#8217;ll be the first man I meet?&#8221; inquired
the other, changing the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not; the class is busily holding a conclave now
to decide who&#8217;s the best. They&#8217;ll send their prize bantam
the first time, though I doubt if we&#8217;ve a man much better
than Billy Williams, the yearling you whipped. Still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
you&#8217;ve got to be at your best, I want to tell you, and I
want you to understand that. When a man&#8217;s been three
years here at West Point, as we have, he&#8217;s in just about
as perfect trim as he ever will be in his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; responded Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not,&#8221; said Fischer, sharply. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the
trouble. I wouldn&#8217;t be warning you if you were. I&#8217;ve
heard of the monkey shines you&#8217;ve been kicking up; Bull
Harris, that good-for-nothing yearling, was blowing
&#8217;round that he&#8217;d put you on a train for New York. The
whole thing is you&#8217;ve been losing sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mallory tried to pass the matter over lightly, but
Fischer was bound to say what he&#8217;d come for.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s none of my business,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ve tried to see you get fair play. And I want to say
this: You rush in to fight those fellows to-day, as
they&#8217;ll try to make you, and you&#8217;ll regret it. That&#8217;s all.
As the challenged party the time is yours to name. If you
refuse for a week at least, I&#8217;ll back you up and see that
it&#8217;s all right, and if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll wish you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of which sage counsel the
dignified captain arose to go. Perhaps his conscience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
troubled him a little anyhow that he&#8217;d stayed so long in
a plebe tent.</p>

<p>He thought of that as he came out and espied three
members of his own class coming down the street and
looking at him. They hailed him as he passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Fischer!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were three who had been the &#8220;committee&#8221;; they
were a committee still, but for a different purpose. Their
purpose was to see Fischer, and when he came toward
them, they led him off to one side. The message that
committee had to give was brief, but it nearly took Fischer
off his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fischer,&#8221; said one, &#8220;the fellows have decided about
that Mallory business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fischer. &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;ll be the man to meet him
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the committee wondered what was the matter with
Fischer.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />


<small>&#8220;I HAVE THE COURAGE TO BE A COWARD.&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Something which happened immediately after Fischer
left the tent effectually drove from Mark&#8217;s mind all ideas
of fights and first classmen. It was the blessed long-expected
signal, a roll upon the drum, the summons to fall
in for the evening&#8217;s dress parade.</p>

<p>And oh, how those plebes were &#8220;spruced up!&#8221; The
four members of the Banded Seven who roomed in Mark&#8217;s
tent had taken turns looking over each other in the effort
to find a single flaw. A member of the guard trying for
colors was never more immaculate than those anxious
strangers. Of the many pair of duck trousers allotted
to each cadet every pair had been critically inspected so
as to get the very whitest. Buttons and belt plates were
little mirrors, and every part of guns and equipments
shone. When those four &#8220;turned out&#8221; of their tent they
felt that they were worthy of the ceremony.</p>

<p>It was an honor to be in the battalion, even if you were
in the rear rank and could see nothing all the time but the
stiffly marching backs in front. And it was an honor to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
have your name called next to a first classman&#8217;s on the
roll. The cadet officer had known the roll by heart and
rattled it off in a breath or two; but now he had to read
it slowly, since the new names were stuck in, which bothered
him if it did delight the plebes.</p>

<p>It was a grand moment when each plebe answered very
solemnly and precisely to his own; and another grand
moment when the cadet band marched down the long line
to its place; and another when the cadet adjutant turned
the parade over to the charge of the officer in command;
and finally, last of all, the climax, when the latter faced
about and gave the order, &#8220;Forward, march!&#8221; when the
band struck up a stirring tune and amid waving of flags
and of handkerchiefs from hundreds of spectators, the all-delighted
plebes strode forward on parade at last.</p>

<p>How tremblingly and nervously he stepped! How gingerly
and cautiously he went through the manual of arms!
And with what a gasp of relief he finally broke ranks at
the sunset gun and realized that actually he had gotten
out of it without a blunder!</p>

<p>Then they marched him down to supper. Formerly the
plebes had marched dejectedly in the rear and sat over in
an obscure corner of the room. That had its advantages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
however, for he did not have to pour the water and wait
till everybody else was helped, and he was not subject
quite so much to the merry badinage of the merciless
yearling. On the whole he was rather glad when supper
was over and after marching back to camp was dismissed
for that day at last.</p>

<p>Mark and his chum, who as we have seen were now interested
in nothing quite so much as sleep, or lack of it,
made for their tents immediately to go to bed. But once
more the fates were against them, for scarcely had they
entered the door before another cadet rushed in. It was
the excited first captain, and he was in such a hurry that
he had not even stopped to remove his sword and sash, the
remnants of &#8220;parade.&#8221; He bore the news that the committee
had imparted to him; and its effect upon Mallory
may be imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fight you,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, man,
you&#8217;re wild.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as serious as I ever was in my life,&#8221; replied the
other. &#8220;The committee from the class told me just before
parade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth made them select you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; groaned Fischer. &#8220;I had a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
fights here&mdash;I whipped Wright, the man you knocked out
the time when the class attacked you so disgracefully.
And they seem to think I&#8217;d stand the most chance, at
least that&#8217;s what the committee said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you tell them?&#8221; inquired Mark, in
alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them? I haven&#8217;t told them anything yet. I was
too horrified to say a word. I&#8217;ve come over to see you
about it. I&#8217;m in a terrible fix.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, refuse, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; demanded Mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; protested the other, &#8220;you don&#8217;t understand
how the class feels about such things. I&#8217;m a
member of it, and when I&#8217;m called upon to defend the
class honor I daren&#8217;t say no. When you have been here
as long as I have you&#8217;ll understand how the cadets would
take it. They&#8217;d be simply furious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do you mean,&#8221; gasped the other, staring at him
in consternation, &#8220;that I&#8217;m expected to fight you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what else,&#8221; responded the captain, reluctantly.
&#8220;What can I tell the class? If I simply say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
I&#8217;ve been rather friendly with you, they&#8217;ll say I had no
business to be. And there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No business to be,&#8221; echoed Mark, thoughtfully, gazing into space.
&#8220;No business to be! Because I&#8217;m a plebe,
I suppose. And I&#8217;ve got to fight you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else are we to do,&#8221; protested the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I shan&#8217;t mind if you whip me, which you probably
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whip you!&#8221; cried Mark; he had sprung to his feet, his
hands clinched. And then without another word he faced
about and fell to striding up and down the tent, the other
watching him anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fischer,&#8221; he demanded suddenly, without looking
at the other, &#8220;suppose I refuse to fight you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it!&#8221; cried Fischer, in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you would be sneered at by the whole corps.
Because they would call you a coward and insult you as
one, cut you dead! You could not stand it one week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221; inquired Mark, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else! What else could there be! For Heaven&#8217;s
sake, man, I won&#8217;t have it! I couldn&#8217;t make the class understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
the reason. You&#8217;d be an outcast all the time you
were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mark turned and gazed at the other, his brown
eyes flashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fischer,&#8221; he began, extending his hands to the
other, &#8220;let me tell you what I have thought of you. You
have been the one friend I have had in this academy outside
of my own class and Wicks Merritt; you have been
the one man who has had the fairness to give me my
rights, the courage to speak for me. I have not always
taken your advice, but I have always respected you and
admired you. And, more than that, I owe my presence
here to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark paused a moment, while his thoughts went back to
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had enemies,&#8221; he continued at last, slowly, &#8220;and
they had me in their power. They had persuaded the
superintendent that I was a criminal, and I looked for
nothing but disgrace. And it was you, then, and you only
of all the cadets of this academy, who had honor and the
courage to help Texas prove my innocence. And that debt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
of gratitude is written where it can never be effaced. My
debt to you! And now they want me to fight you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I can stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for you to stand,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;It is for me.
It is I who owe the debt, and I shall not pay it with
blows. Mr. Fischer, I shall not fight you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will you do? You will be reviled and insulted
as a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark, firmly; &#8220;I will. But as I once told
Texas, there are a few things worse than being called a
coward, and one of them is being one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; protested Fischer. &#8220;But then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are times,&#8221; Mark continued, without heeding
him, &#8220;times, I say, when to fight is wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;This is one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;And at such times it takes more
courage not to fight than to fight. When an army goes
out to battle for the wrong the brave man stays at home.
That is a time when it takes courage to be a coward. And
Mr. Fischer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark took the other by the hand and met his gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fischer, I have the courage to be a coward.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>There was silence after that, except for a muttered
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; from Texas. Mark had said his say, and Fischer
could think of nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; he demanded at last, &#8220;suppose you let
me do the refusing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be best for me to do it,&#8221; said Mark, with decision.
&#8220;Disgrace would be unbearable for you. You
have your duty to your class; I have no duty to any one
but myself. And moreover, I am a plebe, cut by everybody
already and pledged to fight every one. To fight
them a few times more will not hurt. And I really like to
defy them. So just leave it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the end of the talk. Fischer sat and looked
at Mark a few moments more, feeling an admiration he
did not try to express. But when he arose to go the admiration
was in the grip of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You do not realize what you
attempt. But you may rest assured of one thing. I shall
never forget this, never as long as I live. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as the captain&#8217;s figure strode up the street Mark
turned and put his hands on Texas&#8217; shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old fellow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and have you any courage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; protested Texas, solemnly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that kind of courage,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;I
mean courage of the eye, and the heart. Courage of the
mind that knows it&#8217;s right and cares for nothing else. I
mean the courage to be called a coward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; stammered Texas, looking uneasy. Poor
Texas had never thought of that kind of courage. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t very sho&#8217;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&#8217;bout lettin&#8217; anybody call me a
coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I mean to do,&#8221; said Mark. &#8220;I mean to
let them call it, and look them in the eye and laugh. And
we&#8217;ll see what comes of it. I won&#8217;t fight Fischer, and
they can&#8217;t make me. The more they taunt me, the better
I&#8217;ll like it. When they get through perhaps I&#8217;ll get a
chance to show them how much of a coward I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which resolution Mark turned away and prepared
for bed.</p>

<small>MARK, THE COWARD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The taunting of which Mark spoke with such grim and
quiet determination was soon to begin; in fact, he was not
destined to lie down for that night of rest without a taste
of it. He had barely removed the weight of his uniform
jacket, with its collar fastened inside, before he heard a
sound of voices near his tent.</p>

<p>He recognized them instantly; it was the &#8220;committee,&#8221;
and a moment later, in response to his invitation, the three
first classmen entered, bowing most courteously as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; said the spokesman, &#8220;I have come, if
you will pardon my disturbing you, to deliver to you the
decision of our class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mark, simply. &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that Fischer had not seen them, and that
they suspected nothing. A storm was brewing. Mark
gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might just as well come now as any time,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;Steady!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>&#8220;The class will send a man to meet you this evening in
Fort Clinton,&#8221; said the cadet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; responded Mark. &#8220;Thank you. And who is the
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the captain of your company, Mr. Fischer. And
that is about all, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not all,&#8221; observed Mark, very quietly; and then,
as the other turned in surprise, he clinched his fists. &#8220;I
refuse to fight Mr. Fischer,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Refuse to fight him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The three gasped it all at once, in a tone of amazement
that cannot be shown on paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray,&#8221; added the spokesman, &#8220;why do you refuse
to fight Mr. Fischer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My reasons,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;are my own. I never try to
justify my conduct to others. I simply refuse to fight Mr.
Fischer. I&#8217;ll fight any other man you send.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll fight no one else!&#8221; snapped the cadet. &#8220;Mr.
Fischer is the choice of the class. If you refuse to meet
him, and give no reason, it can only be because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you know he&#8217;s too good a man for you!&#8221; put
in one of the others. &#8220;Because you&#8217;re afraid of him!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>Mark never winced at that; he gave the man a look
straight in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some people,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am not afraid of.
I am not afraid of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cadet&#8217;s face turned scarlet, and he clinched his fists
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall pay for that,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the spokesman of the committee seized him and
forced him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, old man,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see
what he&#8217;s trying to do. He&#8217;s afraid of Fischer, and he&#8217;s
trying to force a fight with some one else. He&#8217;s a dirty
coward, so let him alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark heard that plainly, but he never moved a muscle.
It was too much for our tinder-box Texan, however;
Texas had been perspiring like a man in a torture chamber
during this ordeal, and just then he leaped forward with a
yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ole white-faced coyote, you, doggone your boots,
I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas!&#8221; said Mark, in his quiet way.</p>

<p>And Texas shut up like an angry oyster and went back
into the corner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said Mark, &#8220;I think our interview
is at an end. You understand my point. And that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as for you,&#8221; retorted the other. &#8220;Do you understand
your position? You will be branded by the cadets
as a coward. You will fight Fischer as sure as the class
can make you. And you will fight no one else, either, until
you fight him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mark bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll allow me to express my opinion of you
right here,&#8221; snapped the insulted one, who was going to
fight a moment ago. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t get angry about it,
either, because you&#8217;ve no redress till you fight Fischer.
You&#8217;re a coward, sir! Your whole conduct since you
came here has been one vulgar attempt to put up a bluff
with nothing to back it. And you lack the first instincts
of a gentleman, most of all, sir, because you&#8217;ll swallow
such insults from me instead of fighting, and taking the
licking you&#8217;ve earned. You can&#8217;t fight me till you&#8217;ve
fought Fischer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t, hey! Say, d&#8217; you think I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to stan&#8217;
sich&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Texas!&#8221;</p>

<p>And once more there was quiet, at the end of which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
indignant committee faced about without a word and
marched out in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not worth fooling with,&#8221; said the spokesman, audibly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>After which Mark turned to Texas and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the first dose, old man,&#8221; said he. &#8220;How did
you like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>From Texas&#8217; face he liked it about as well as a mouthful
of quinine, and if Texas hadn&#8217;t been very, very sleepy
he would probably have lain awake all night growling like
an irate volcano, and wondering how Mark could snore
away so happily while such things were happening.</p>

<p>Though Mark slept, there were no end of others who
didn&#8217;t sleep on account of him. The committee, just as
soon as they had gotten outside, had rushed off to tell the
story of &#8220;Mallory&#8217;s flunk,&#8221; and pretty soon there were
groups of first classmen and yearlings standing about the
camp indignantly discussing the state of affairs. There
were various opinions and theories, but only one conclusion:</p>

<p>That plebe Mallory&#8217;s a coward!</p>

<p>Fischer was not there to gainsay it, he being absent on
duty, and so the cadets had no one to shed any light on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
the matter, which they continued to rave about right up
to the time for tattoo. The first class was so worked up
over it that there was an impromptu meeting gathered to
discuss it just outside of the camp.</p>

<p>The angry mob was reduced to an orderly meeting a
little later by the president of the class, who appeared on
the scene and called the cadets to order to discuss ways
and means of &#8220;swamping Mallory.&#8221; For every one agreed
that something ought to be done that very night. As has
been stated, they never dispersed until the very moment
of tattoo; by that time they had their campaign mapped
out. It was a very unpleasant programme for poor Mark.</p>

<p>He had to dress and turn out, of course, at tattoo to
answer to his name before he retired for the night. Not
a word was said to him then; yet he could see by the angry
looks and frowns he met with that the story of his conduct
was abroad. But Mark had not the least idea of
what was coming, and he went back to his tent and fell
asleep again in no time.</p>

<p>It is an old, old story, an old, old incident. To tell it
again would weary the reader. That night a dozen men,
chosen by the class for their powerful build, instead of going
to sleep when taps sounded, lay awake and waited till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the camp got quiet. They waited till the tac had gone
the rounds with his lantern, and then to his tent for the
night. They waited till the sentry&#8217;s call had been heard
for the fourth time since taps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock and all&#8217;s we-ell!&#8221;</p>

<p>They they got up and dressed once more, and stole silently
out into the darkness of the night. Outside, in the
company street, they met and had a whispered consultation,
then surrounded a certain &#8220;plebe hotel&#8221; and finally
stole away in triumph, bearing four helpless plebes along
with them. A while later they had passed the sentry and
had their victims bound and gagged, lying in a lonely
corner of old Fort Clinton.</p>

<p>The cadets thought four would be enough that night.
They meant to give those plebes the worst licking they
had ever had in their lives. That would be a pretty severe
one, especially for Mallory, who had been roughly
handled before. But the first classmen had agreed among
themselves that there was no call for mercy here.</p>

<p>The reader may perhaps wish to be spared the details
of the preparation. Suffice it to say that those heavily
bound unfortunates were stretched out upon the ground,
that their backs were bared, and then that the four brawniest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
of the desperate cadets took four pieces of rope in
their hands and stepped forward. It was estimated that
when they stepped back those four plebes would be in a
more docile mood than previously.</p>

<p>A dead silence had fallen upon the group; it had increased
in numbers every moment, for other cadets had
stolen out to see what was being done. And just then
every one of them was leaning forward anxiously, staring
at Mallory, for nobody cared anything much about the
other three, whether they were attended to or not. It was
Mallory, the coward, against whom all the hatred was;
Mallory, whom the biggest man had been deputed to attend
to. All the other &#8220;executioners&#8221; were waiting, leaning
forward anxiously to see how Mallory took it.</p>

<p>The cadet who held the rope seized it in a firm grip, and
swung it about his head. A moment later it came down
through the air with a whirr. It struck the white flesh of
the helpless plebe with a thud that made the crowd shudder.
A broad red streak seemed to leap into view, and
the victim quivered all over. The cadet raised the lash
once more and once more brought it down; and again an
instant later.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>The end of it came soon, fortunately; and it came without
waiting the wish of the &#8220;hazers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once before that game had been tried on Mallory, then
by the infuriated yearlings. An alarm from camp had
interrupted it at an earlier stage. And that happened
again. This time there broke upon the stillness of the
midnight air the sharp report of a gun. It came from
nearby, too, and it brought no end of confusion with it,
confusion that will be told of later.</p>

<p>As to the hazers, they glanced at each other in consternation.
That gun would awaken the camp! And they
would be discovered! There was not a second to lose!</p>

<p>In a trice the four plebes were cut loose, left to get
back to their tent as best they could; and a few moments
later a mob of hurrying figures dashed past the sentry and
into Camp McPherson, which they found in an uproar.
The hazing of Mallory was over for that night beyond a
doubt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />


<small>A TEST OF COURAGE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The story of the sacred geese that saved the city of
Rome is known to every schoolboy. Not so long ago the
classic Parson, of the Banded Seven, told of a spider who
saved the life of Bruce the Scot, by building a web over
the entrance of the log he hid in. As life-savers, dogs
and even horses are famous, too, but it is left to the historian
of these pages to tell of how a rescue was effected
by a mouse.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think to be told it was a mouse who fired
that gun and saved Mark. Well, in a sense it was true.</p>

<p>The mouse who is our hero lived in the West Point
Hotel, situated a very short way beyond the camp. And
the tale of his deed, unlike the mouse&#8217;s tail, is a very short
one. It was simply that some one left a box of matches
upon a table in the kitchen, and that the mouse got after
those matches. There you have it.</p>

<p>Some of them fell to the floor, and the mouse went
after them. He bit one, after the fashion of inquisitive
mice; then, scared at the result, turned and scampered off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
in haste. Inquisitive persons sometimes make no end of
trouble.</p>

<p>There was a piece of paper near the match, and then
more paper, and the leg of the table. There was also
plenty of time and no one to interfere. Every one who
was in that building, except the clerks and the watchman
in the office, was sleeping soundly by that time of night,
and so the small crackling fire was in no hurry. It crept
up the leg of the table, its bright forked tongues dancing
about gayly as it did so. Then it leaped over to a curtain
at the window, and then still more swiftly to the window
frame, and still there was no one to see it.</p>

<p>Quietly at rest in that hotel, and unsuspecting, were
some dozens of guests, including one that interests us
above all others, Grace Fuller. Her room was now on
the top floor of the hotel, and in the corner of the building
that was fast getting warm and choking.</p>

<p>It is a horrible thing, the progress of a fire through the
still watches of the night. Creeping ahead and crackling
it goes, so slowly and yet with such deadly and inevitable
purpose. It has been called a devouring fiend; it has
greedy tongues that steal on and lick up everything, and
grow hungrier and more savage as they feed. And it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
breathes forth volumes of deep black poison that stupefy
its victims till it comes to seize them.</p>

<p>The unguarded kitchen of the hotel was soon a roaring
furnace, and then the fire crept out into the hall, and as
the glass of the windows cracked and a rush of fresh air
fanned in, the flames leaped up the staircase as if it had
been the chimney, and then spread through the parlor, and
on upward, farther and farther still. And how were people
to get down those stairs if they did not hurry about it?</p>

<p>The people were not thinking of that; they were not
even beginning to have bad dreams until the smoke got
just a little thicker, until the halls outside got just a little
hotter, until the fire had moved on from the basement to
the ground floor, and from the ground floor to the next
above. And even then they were not destined to discover
it. That task was left to some one else.</p>

<p>It was a sentry, a sentry of the regular army, facing the
walk called Professor&#8217;s Row. That sentry had no business
to leave his post, but he did it none the less, and
dashed across the street to look, as he caught sight of
that unusual glare from the windows of the old hotel.
An instant later he had swung up his musket to his shoulder,
snapped back the trigger, and then came the roar of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
the gun that the startled cadets had heard from the deep
recesses of the fort.</p>

<p>The sentry, the instant he had fired, lowered the gun,
snapped out the cartridge, and slid in another to fire
again. Before the camp had gotten its eyes open a third
report had come also, the dreaded signal of fire. The
sentry had done his duty then, and he set out once more
to march back and forth upon his post.</p>

<p>The wild excitement that ensued it is impossible to picture;
everything in camp was moving and shouting at
once. Lieutenant Allen, the tac of Company A, on duty
for the night, had leaped from his bed at the first bang,
and from his tent at the second. His yell for the drum orderly
brought that youngster out flying, and the third report
of the gun was echoed by a rattle of drums that
seemed never to stop. It was the dreaded &#8220;long roll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cadets sleep in their underclothing, like firemen, ready
for just such an emergency as this. They were springing
into their clothing before they were entirely awake, and
rushing out to form in the company street before they
were half in their clothing. Those who had been into
Fort Clinton were the first in line, and as the others followed
they heard the cadet adjutant rattling through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
list of names, and Lieutenant Allen shouting orders as if
trying to drown the other&#8217;s mighty voice. And above it
all rang shrieks and cries from the now awakened inmates
of the building, the glare of the fire shining through
the trees.</p>

<p>It was the matter of but a minute or two for the company
fire battalion to be out and ready for duty. But at
such times as these seconds grow to hours. Fischer, out
of his tent among the first, and quick to think, spoke a
few words to the lieutenant, and at his nod dashed on
ahead with the cadets from the guard tent at his heels.
And it is Fischer we must follow now.</p>

<p>Things were happening with frightful rapidity just
then. Fischer and his little command, when they got
there, found that fully half the occupants of the place had
managed to get out already. They had gotten a ladder
and were raising it to the piazza roof. Up that ladder
the cadets rushed, and then raised it after them and put
it up to the next floor and sped on. Into the smoke-laden
rooms they dashed, and through the glaring flames in the
halls, pausing at nothing, hearing nothing but the ringing
commands of their leader. There was work for the members
of the guard detail that night, and glory for Fischer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>They were still at work helping women and children
out when the battalion put in an appearance, coming on
the double-quick with a cheer of encouragement. They
bore buckets and more ladders, and behind them, still
faster, clattered the members of the cavalry company of
the post. The two bodies reached the scene at about the
same instant, and each went to work with a will.</p>

<p>The white uniforms of the cadets shone in the yellow
glare of the flames; there were some pale faces staring
into that light and some trembling knees. But there was
no trembling or hesitating among the officers in command.
They had the pumps working, and long lines of
bucket passers formed in no time. And there were ladders
at the windows and details of cadets searching the
smoke-laden rooms.</p>

<p>The work of rescue was nearly over, however, by the
time the battalion got there, thanks to the fearless efforts
of the first captain&#8217;s prompt little band. Fischer had
thought all were out, and had settled down to emptying
water on the flames, when the alarm we have to do with
was given.</p>

<p>It came from a white-haired figure, an old gentleman,
who rushed up breathless and panting to the scene. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
one recognized him, and started in horror as they heard
his cry. It was Judge Fuller.</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter! My daughter!&#8221; he shrieked. &#8220;Oh, save
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rushed to one of the ladders, about to spring into the
very center of the flames. Several of the cadets forced
him back, and at the same instant a ringing cheer broke
from the whole battalion. It was Fischer once more; he
had been standing on the roof when he heard the cry, and
like a flash he had turned and bounded in at the window.
He was lost then to view, swallowed up in the smoke and
flames. And, scarcely breathing, the crowd outside stood
and stared at the windows and waited.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are asking what of Mark, with Grace
Fuller, the joy of his life, in peril. Mark was down in
the long line, passing buckets like any dutiful plebe. He
had heard Judge Fuller&#8217;s terrible warning, and had been
quick to spring forward. But the watchful &#8220;tac&#8221; had had
his eye on Mark, knowing his friendship for the girl.
Lieutenant Allen did not mean to have his lines broken up
in that way; there were others to attend to that rescue,
and he ordered Mallory back to his place with a stern
command that Mallory dared not disobey. Now he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
standing like a warrior in chains amid the battle&#8217;s roar,
watching with the rest, and trembling with horror and
dread.</p>

<p>What if Fischer should fail&mdash;be beaten back? What if
smoke should overcome him, and he should sink where
he was? What if Grace Fuller&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then, oh, how he did gasp for joy! And what a
perfect roar of triumph rose from the anxious crowd.
There was the gallant captain, smoke-stained and staggering,
standing in a window on the top floor, holding in
his arms a figure white as snow. The girl was safe!</p>

<p>But how was she to get down?</p>

<p>That was the dreadful thought that flashed over the
trembling cadet. They stood irresolute, and so did the
cadet in the window, hesitating at times when a second
might mean the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>And yet who could advise him? The girl&#8217;s waving
hair and dress would catch at the slightest flame; to try
the roaring staircase was suicide. Then should he drop
her? The crowd shuddered to think of that, yet what
else could he do? There was no ladder to reach halfway.
He must! He was going to!</p>

<p>Picture the state of Mark Mallory&#8217;s mind at that moment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Himself helpless, watching Fischer preparing for
that horrible deed. He saw the cadet drag a half-blazing
mattress from one of the rooms, laying it on the roof below.
He heard the agonized shriek of the girl&#8217;s father, he
pictured that lovely figure perhaps dying, certainly maimed
for life. He saw Fischer passing the body through the
window, his figure wreathed in smoke, with a setting of
fire behind. And then, with a shout that was a perfect
roar of command, Mark leaped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>A thousand tacs could not hold him then; he was like
a wild man. He saw a chance, a chance that no one dared.
But he&mdash;what was he, compared with perfection, Grace
Fuller?</p>

<p>He fairly tore a path up the ladder.</p>

<p>He paused but an instant on the roof of the piazza, to
shout to Fischer, then seized in his hand a rope that some
were vainly trying to toss up to the window. That rope
Mark took in his teeth; ran his eye up the long rainspout
on the wall; and an instant later gave a spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221; shouted one of the cadets, who saw his
purpose. &#8220;It&#8217;s hot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot? It burned his hands to the bone, but what did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
Mark care? Again and again he seized it, again and again
with his mighty arms he jerked himself upward, gripping
the pipe between his knees, gripping the rope like death,
higher and higher!</p>

<p>How the crowd gasped and trembled! He reached the
first floor, halfway. He might have climbed that on a
ladder, if he had only thought. But it was too late now.
On! on! The smoke curled about him and choked him,
hid him from view; bright flames leaped out from the
seething windows and enveloped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;His clothes are afire!&#8221; shouted one. &#8220;Oh, heavens!&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the smoke he came. Tongues of fire were starting
at his trousers, at the end of his coat, getting larger,
climbing higher, upon him. And still on he went, his flesh
raw, his lungs hot and dry, his strength failing him. And
ever about was the fluttering of white, a signal of distress
that nerved him to clutch the burning iron yet once
again.</p>

<p>Fischer was leaning from the window, straining every
nerve, almost hanging by his knees, with outstretched
hands. Mallory was climbing, fainting, almost unconscious,
still gazing up and gasping. And the crowd could
not make a move.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>And then an instant later it was over. They saw
Fischer give a sudden convulsive clutch beneath him;
they saw the gallant plebe totter and sway, cling an instant
more, and then, without uttering a sound, plunge
downward like a flaming shot and strike with a thud upon
the mattress below. But Fischer held the rope!</p>

<small>THE FRUITS OF VICTORY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Grace Fuller was safe then, and everybody knew it.
But somehow that crowd did not give a single cheer; in
fact, every one seemed to have forgotten that she and
Fischer were there, and all made a rush for Mallory.</p>

<p>Fischer fastened the rope inside the building, wrapped
it about his wrist, took the unconscious figure in his one
free arm, and slid swiftly down to safety, just in time to
see the flames that threatened Mallory extinguished by the
cadets. Grace Fuller was unconscious, so she knew nothing
of this, but Fischer did, and he staggered over toward
the gallant plebe.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is he?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How is he? Don&#8217;t tell me
he&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fischer hated to say the word, but as he stared at the
motionless figure he feared that it was true, that Mallory
had given his life for his friends.</p>

<p>A surgeon was at his side an instant later, bending over
the prostrate form&mdash;Mallory was unconscious and nearly
dead from exhaustion and pain alone. His legs were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
burned to a blister, his hands were a sight to make one
sick. As to the fall, who could say? The surgeon shook
his head sadly as he got up and called for a stretcher to
carry the lad down to the hospital.</p>

<p>That incident once past the battalion turned its energies
to extinguishing the flames. But they were listless
and careless energies for some reason. There seemed to
be something on the battalion&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>A guilty conscience is a poor companion for any work.
And the thought of Mallory and what he had done, and
what they had done to him, gave the cadets a very guilty
conscience indeed.</p>

<p>Those who had taken part in that beating were the most
worried and unhappy of all, for they had done something
they might never be able to atone for. They seemed to
hear those words of Mallory&#8217;s&mdash;and they thought of how
true they had come&mdash;&#8220;Some day I may have a chance to
show you how much of a coward I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>They got the fire out entirely in an hour or two, and
then sadly the corps marched back to the silent camp.
There was a noticeable lack of satisfaction one might have
expected to see after the weary task was so creditably
performed. The thought of Mallory was a weight of lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
upon the heart of every one. That plebe had suddenly
become the one object of all the hopes and prayers of the
corps.</p>

<p>Groups of silent lads gathered about the tents, conversing
in low and subdued whispers when they said anything
at all. The picture of Mallory&#8217;s figure clinging to the side
of that burning house was before their eyes every moment.
Fischer had told them the story of Mallory&#8217;s reasons for
daring their wrath, and his news put the plebe&#8217;s action in
quite a different light. It made the cadets yet more remorseful
for their cruelty.</p>

<p>George Elliot has remarked that &#8220;when Death, the
great Reconciler comes, it is not our leniency, but our
harshness we repent of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drug sounded taps a few minutes later for the second
time that night. The cadets scattered silently to their
tents, realizing that they would have to wait until the
morrow to get tidings of poor Mallory&#8217;s fate.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that West Point&#8217;s interest in the
matter was so great that even military rules could not
stand before it. The cadets had scarcely fallen asleep
again, before several members of the guard went from
tent to tent with the glad tidings from the hospital that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Cadet Mallory and Miss Grace Fuller were conscious and
would surely recover. And the news was sent by order
of Lieutenant Allen himself.</p>

<p>Two days later Mark was lying upon a bed in the
cadet hospital. We would scarcely have known Mark,
to look at him; his face was pale and his arm trembled
when he moved it. But Mark was happy for all that.</p>

<p>He was reaping the fruits of his bravery, then. He
was still in pain, it is true; any one who has ever blistered
one&#8217;s finger with fire may be able to imagine the
feelings Mark got from those two bandaged hands of
his. But he had forgotten all about that for a time.</p>

<p>The reason for that is not far to seek. The sunlight
as it streamed into that room was reflected from
a wealth of golden hair that in turn lit up
Mark&#8217;s pale features. It was Grace Fuller who was
sitting by his bedside; and Grace Fuller was trying to
thank him for what he had done for her.</p>

<p>Her tone was low and earnest as she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark,&#8221; she said&mdash;&#8220;I have never called you Mark before,
but I will now, if you will let me&mdash;the debt I owe
to you I can never repay; but if true friendship is anything
you may have that. That is all I can give.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>Mark answered nothing; but he gazed at the girl
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the second time,&#8221; continued she, &#8220;that you
have been in this hospital for me. I do not know what
others think of it, but I know that I shall never forget
it as long as I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Concerning what others thought, Grace was very
speedily to learn. It is necessary to interrupt her thankful
words, for just then an unpoetic attendant came into
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there are some cadets outside
who want to see you. The surgeon says that they
may&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send them in,&#8221; said Mark, weakly. And then he
added to Grace, with a faint attempt at a smile: &#8220;I wonder
if they want me to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grace said nothing to that, but her eyes flashed for a
moment. She had heard the story of how the cadets had
treated Mark, and she had made up her mind that if they
had anything more to say about cowardice she was going
to take a hand. Grace Fuller had her own ideas on the
subject of cowards.</p>

<p>The cadets entered the room a moment later, and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Mark glanced at them he started with no little surprise.
It was the committee from the first class, the same committee
that had been taunting him a few days previously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen?&#8221; said Mark, inquiringly.</p>

<p>Evidently the cadets had an embarrassing task before
them. They had sidled into the room rather awkwardly,
all the more so when they espied Grace Fuller&#8217;s beautiful
face, which was all the more beautiful for its present
paleness.</p>

<p>Once in the room they had backed up against the wall,
eying the two uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said the spokesman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; inquired Mark again.</p>

<p>By way of answer the spokesman took from beneath
his jacket a folded paper. This he opened before him
with some solemnity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Mallory,&#8221; he began&mdash;&#8220;ahem! I have been appointed,
together with my two classmates here, to&mdash;er&mdash;convey
to you the following notice from the first class.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the spokesman stopped abruptly and shifted uneasily.
Mark bowed, as well as he could under the circumstances.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>&#8220;This letter,&#8221; continued the cadet, &#8220;is from the president
of the class. Listen, please:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Cadet Mallory</span>, West Point:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: As president of the first class of the corps
of cadets I have the duty and pleasure of submitting to
you the following set of resolutions adopted unanimously
by the class at a meeting held this morning.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright3">&#8220;&#8216;Respectfully Yours,</span><br />

<span class="gapright2">&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">George T. Fischer</span>,</span><br />

&#8220;&#8216;Cadet Captain, Company A.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>After that imposing document the spokesman paused
for breath. Mark waited in silence. When the cadet
thought that there had been suspense enough for so important
an occasion he raised the paper and continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whereas&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cadet Mallory of the fourth class has performed
before the whole academy an act of heroism and self-sacrifice
which merits immediate and signal recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Resolved&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the class hereby desires, both as a class and as
individuals, to offer to Cadet Mallory their sincere
apology for all offensive remarks addressed to him under
any circumstances whatsoever.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the class hereby expresses the greatest regret
for all attacks made by it upon Cadet Mallory.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That the class hereby extends to Cadet Mallory its
assurance of respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And that the president of the class be requested to
forward a copy of these resolutions to Cadet Mallory at
once.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>At the close of this most imposing document the young
cadet folded the paper and put it away, then gazed at
Mark with a what-more-do-you-want? sort of air. As
for Mark, he was lying back on his pillow gazing into
space and thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty decent,&#8221; he observed, meditatively; then
he raised himself up and gazed at the three quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the first class,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I cannot make much
of a speech, but that I accept their apology with the same
sincerity it&#8217;s given. I thank them for their regards, and
also for having released me from my fighting obligations.
And now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;since this appears to be a time of
mutual brotherly love, concession and reciprocity, I don&#8217;t
mind taking a share myself. Tell the class that it&#8217;s very
probable that when I join them again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mark paused in order to let his important announcement
have due weight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to be a little less B. J. Good-afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that letter&#8217;s great!&#8221; cried Texas, when he heard
of it. &#8220;Whoop! I almost feel like hurrahing for them
old first classers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very nice,&#8221; said the Parson. &#8220;Yea, by Zeus, it&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t do less, b&#8217;gee!&#8221; cried Dewey. &#8220;Mark
shamed &#8217;em all, b&#8217;gee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the Banded Seven agreed&mdash;just as they always
did.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
